In the {\tt statistics\_biblio} folder there is a bash script which 
analyses the .bib file of FieldStone. I also have another script on 
my computer which analyses the pdf files in my literature folder:

{\captionfont Evolution of the number of references cited in FieldStone
per year. The purple line tracks the pdf files in my folder while 
the green line accounts for the entries in my .bib file.}
\end{center}

In what follows I have selected a subset of all journals present in 
my bib file and report on the number of articles per year for each of them:

so I further break it down per journal:
