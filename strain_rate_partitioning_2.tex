each is deformed with the same strain rate $\dot{\varepsilon}_T$
and their stresses add up:
\[
\tau = \tau_1 + \tau_2 = 2 \eta_1 \dot{\varepsilon}_T  + 2 \eta_2 \dot{\varepsilon}_T
\]
and since we define the effective viscosity as $\tau = 2 \eta_{eff} \dot{\varepsilon}_T$ then it follows:
\[
2 \eta_{eff} \dot{\varepsilon}_T = 2 \eta_1 \dot{\varepsilon}_T  + 2 \eta_2 \dot{\varepsilon}_T
\]
or, 
\[
\eta_{eff} = \eta_1 + \eta_2 
\]
i.e., the effective viscosity of two or more viscous dampers is the sum of their viscosities ({\sl 
but not their arithmetic mean!}).
