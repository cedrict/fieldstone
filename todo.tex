\item sort our s40rts stones/theory
\item change cell type in all stones containing Q2
\item find Dave Whipp vids \url{https://www.youtube.com/@helsinkiuniversitygeodynam6511/videos}
\begin{itemize}
\item set 2: Kinematics of plate tectonics
\item set 3: forces and stresses
\item set 4: measuring stress and strain 
\item set 5: basics of elasticity
\item set 6: flexure of the lithosphere
\item set 7: heat conduction and production

\item set 9: basic of fluid mechanics
\item set 10: plate-driving forces
\item set 11: brittle deformation and faulting
\item set 12: viscous deformation, strength of the lithosphere
\item set 13: climatic, geomorphic and geodynamic processes
\end{itemize}
\item scan biblio of Yuen, Olson, Turcotte, Travis
\item produce appendix about making presentations dos/donts 
\item finish 133 about double jacobian
\item write about Scott-Vogelius element, document literature. 
\item incorporate Scott-Vogelius in f120. P2P-1 on bary meshes
\item do P1P0 on special bary mesh
\item do QkQk-1Q-1 stone
\item replace cal I,K, by III, KKK, FFF, QQQ in invariants 
\item check Q2Q1+graddiv vs Q2Q1 or Q2P-1. report. paper ?
  \item write about impose bc on el matrix
  \item write about stream functions 
  \item write section in features about thermo mechanical simulations and how/why we solve vp, then T.

\section{Questions I have, Things I need to (better) understand}

These are not particularly well posed. 

\begin{itemize}
\item how does FLAC work?
\item how does propagator matrix work? what is it ? \cite{ribe18}  \cite{qizp18}
\item in FEM, time derivative handled by FDM but not FEM?
\item why not ok to prescribe T on outflow boundary. check aspect manual
\item the need to underintegrate penalty term
\item pseudo-transient methods
\item what does it mean to have a negative pressure ? should we threshold it when computing yield strength ? 
\item Why pressure bc works for Q2Q1 but not Q1P0 ??
\item is there a formal definition of shape fct, trial fct, basis fct vs test fct 
\item is there an efficient manner to start from (say) quadrilateral mesh defined by corners only, choose an 
order $n$ corresponding to $Q_n \times Q_{n-1}$ and generate nodes without doubles?
\end{itemize}
