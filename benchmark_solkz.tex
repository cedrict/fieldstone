The SolKz benchmark is similar to the SolCx benchmark: 
the viscosity is a function of the space coordinates too and is given by 
\[
\eta(y)=\exp(2By) \qquad \text{with} \qquad B=13.8155
\]
It is not a discontinuous function but it grows exponentially with the 
vertical coordinate so that its overall variation is again $10^6$. 
The forcing is chosen by imposing a spatially variable density variation as follows:
\[
\rho(x,y)=\sin(2y) \cos(3\pi x)
\]
Free slip boundary conditions are imposed on all sides of the domain.
This benchmark too is presented in \textcite{zhon96} (1996) 
and is studied in \textcite{dumg11} (2011) and \textcite{gemd13} (2013).
