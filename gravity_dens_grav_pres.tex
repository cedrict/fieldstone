In the Earth's mantle major solid state phase transitions occur in the 
silicate material which constitutes the planetary mantle
outside the metallic iron/nickle core.
These phase transitions are induced by the increase in the static
pressure from a 1 bar ($10^5\si{\pascal}$) atmospheric value at the Earth's surface to 
$136 \cdot 10^9\si{\pascal}$ at the core mantle boundary at a depth of
approximately 2900\si{\kilo\metre}.
Phase transitions in the Earth's interior are associated with changes 
in the elastic wave velocities that can be deduced from seismological 
observations.
In high pressure experiments, phase transitions in candidate mantle
silicates can be studied and correlated with the seismological data
to constrain the mineralogy and pressure/temperature distribution 
in the mantle.
Knowledge of the internal material constitution of the Earth,
such as the mineral phase,
is a requirement for understanding the main geodynamical processes that determine
Earth's evolution.

Density and pressure inside the Earth are linked with self-gravitation.
This means that the hydrostatic or lithostatic pressure is a direct 
result of the gravity field generated by the Earth's own mass 
distribution.
The lithostatic pressure can be expressed as the weight of a column
of unit cross-sectional area extending from zero depth, at the Earth's 
surface, to the depth $z$ of the evaluation point,
\begin{equation}
 P(z) = \int_0^z \rho(z') g(z') dz'
\label{def_pressure_integ}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the mass density and $g$ is the magnitude of
the gravitational acceleration.

The gravity field defining $g$ is generated by the Earth's own density 
distribution.
Weak periodic gravity `perturbations' are generated by celestial
bodies, expressed in the external tides, both ocean tides and solid
earth tides.
The main tides are generated by the Earth's moon and by the Sun.

In the following section expressions for the gravity field in terms
of the density distribution are given, based on Newton's law of
gravitation.

In the description of the density distribution we will first neglect 
the role of self-compression and consider a number of one-dimensional 
(1-D), spherically symmetric, parameterized density distributions.
Self-compression and compressibility are then treated in section 
\ref{Pressure_density}.
Self-compression and finite compressibility result in a 
continuous increase of density with pressure in agreement 
with several geophysical observations.

\subsubsection{Gravity field of a mass distribution}
Newton formulated the attraction force acting on a point 
mass $m_0$,  located in a point with position vector ${\vec r}=(x,y,z)$,
with $x,y,z$ the cartesian coordinates,
from a second point mass $m_1$ located at
${\vec r}_1=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$, illustrated in the following figure as,
\begin{equation}
{\vec F} ({\vec r}) 
=\frac{{\cal G} m_0 m_1}{\left | {\vec r}_1 - {\vec r} \right | ^2} ~ 
          {\vec e}_{\vec{r} \vec{r}_1}
\label{pointmass_gravity}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{images/gravity/gravity_diagram}\\
{\captionfont Vector diagram of the gravitational forces acting on the two 
point masses $m_0$, $m_1$ in vector locations ${\vec r}$ and
${\vec r}_1$ respectively.
From the expression for the gravity field (\ref{pointmass_gravity}) 
it follows that the forces on both masses
are of equal magnitude and in opposite direction.}
\end{center}

Where ${\vec e}_{\vec{r}\vec{r}_1}$ is the unit vector in 
${\vec r}$ pointing towards ${\vec r}_1$
and ${\vec F}({\vec r}_1) = - {\vec F}({\vec r})$.
${\vec r}, {\vec r}_1$ 
are the position vectors of the two point masses
and 
$\left | {\vec r}_1 - {\vec r} \right | =
\sqrt{(x_1-x)^2 + (y_1-y)^2 + (z_1-z)^2}$
is the distance between the points ${\vec r}$ and ${\vec r}_1$.
${\cal G}$ is the gravitational constant 
${\cal G} \simeq 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \si{\newton\square\metre\per\square\kilo\gram}$,
$m_0, m_1$ the mass of the respective pointmasses.


This gravitation effect is usually specified as a gravitation force per 
unit mass or acceleration vector ${\vec g}$,
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!5]
\begin{equation}
{\vec g}({\vec r}) =
\frac{{\cal G} m_1}{\left | {\vec r}_1 - {\vec r} \right | ^2} ~ {\vec e}_{\vec{r}\vec{r}_1} 
\label{grav_accel}
\end{equation}
\end{mdframed}
It can be verified by inspection that the acceleration vector field 
can be written as the 
gradient of a scalar potential field $U({\vec r})$ (i.e. the potential
energy per unit mass) with
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!5]
\[
{\vec g} = - \vec\nabla U = 
(- \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}, 
 - \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}, 
 - \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}),\]
\end{mdframed}
in Cartesian coordinates (see problem \ref{problem-verify-gradient}),
and
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!5]
\begin{equation}
U({\vec r}) = - \frac{{\cal G} m_1}{\left | {\vec r}_1 - {\vec r} \right |} 
\label{grav_potential}
\end{equation}
\end{mdframed}

The gravity acceleration and corresponding potential field are additive 
such that the total force or potential of a 
collection of $N$ point masses is obtained by summation over individual
point contributions,
\begin{equation}
{\vec g} ({\vec r}) = 
\sum_j^N \frac{{\cal G} m_j}{\left | {\vec r}_j - {\vec r} \right | ^2} ~ {\vec e}_{\vec{r}\vec{r}_j}
, 
\qquad
U({\vec r}) = 
- \sum_j^N \frac{{\cal G} m_j}{\left | {\vec r}_j - {\vec r} \right |}
\label{eq:gUexo}
\end{equation}
With this definition and sign convention the potential field of
a point source in the origin is represented by a
potential well ($U({\vec r}) < 0$).
This is known as Coulomb's law and the equivalent form for a continuous
mass distribution of density $\rho$ (mass per unit volume) contained in
a volume $V$ is,
\begin{equation}
{\vec g}({\vec r}) = 
\int_V \frac{{\cal G} \rho({\vec r}^{'})}
{\left | {\vec r}^{'} - {\vec r} \right | ^2} ~ 
{\vec e}_{\vec{r}\vec{r}^{'}} ~ dV({\vec r}^{'})
,
\qquad 
U({\vec r}) = 
- \int_V \frac{{\cal G} \rho({\vec r}^{'})}
                     {\left | {\vec r}^{'} - {\vec r} \right |} ~ 
dV({\vec r}^{'})
\label{Coulomb-integrals}
\end{equation}

\vspace{.4cm}

Besides the integral expression for the gravity field defined in
(\ref{Coulomb-integrals}) there is also the differential form
using the second order partial differential equations of Laplace and
Poisson.
It can be shown by verification (see hereafter) that $U$ in (\ref{Coulomb-integrals})
satisfies Poisson's equation, 
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!5]
\begin{equation}
\vec\nabla^2 U = 4\pi {\cal G}\rho  \label{poisson_eqn}
\end{equation}
\end{mdframed}
which reduces to Laplace's equation $\vec\nabla^2 U = 0$
outside the mass distribution in $V$ (where $\rho =0$). 

To show that $U$ in (\ref{Coulomb-integrals}) satisfies Poisson's
equation integrate the normal component of the acceleration field
over an arbitrary closed surface $S$ enclosing $V$
and change the order of integration for the volume and surface
integral.
\begin{equation}
\int_S \vec\nabla U({\vec r}) \cdot {\vec n} \ dA({\vec r})
   = - \int_V {\cal G} \rho({\vec r}^{'}) 
    \left \{
     \int_S 
       \vec\nabla 
       \left ( \frac{1}{\left | {\vec r}^{'}-{\vec r} \right |} \right )
      \cdot {\vec n} \ dA({\vec r}) 
    \right \} dV({\vec r}^{'})
\label{surface_integral}
\end{equation}
The surface integral on the right is independent of the choice of the
surface $S$ as long as it contains ${\vec r}^{'}$.
We therefore replace this surface by a sphere of radius $R$ centered
at $r^{'}$ and find for the surface integral the value $- 4 \pi$.
\newline
Next we apply the Gauss divergence theorem to the left hand surface 
integral to obtain,
\begin{equation}
\int_V \vec\nabla^2 U \ dV = \int_V 4 \pi {\cal G} \rho \ dV  
\label{int_form_poisson}
\end{equation}
Note that the surface has been contracted on the volume $V$
to obtain (\ref{int_form_poisson}).
Since the surface and enclosed volume are arbitrary we obtain the Poisson
equation,
\begin{equation}
\vec\nabla^2 U  = 4 \pi {\cal G} \rho 
\end{equation}


\vspace{.4cm}

In Newton's time the numerical value of ${\cal G}$ had not been
determined yet. 
As a result it was not possible to determine the mass of the 
Earth $M_{\oplus}$ by measuring the gravitation force of the Earth 
on a known `test mass'.
This way only the value of $G M_{\oplus}$ could be determined.
Only with the experiment named after Cavendish (1798)
\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment}}
it became possible
to measure ${\cal G}$ directly, in a torsion balance experiment,
by determining the gravitational attraction of two closely spaced test 
masses shown here:  

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/gravity/Cavendish_Experiment}
\end{center}

Since Cavendish many experiments have been conducted in order to 
determine the value of this constant:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{images/gravity/big_G}\\
{\captionfont This chart compares the results from a dozen experiments measuring ${\cal G}$. 
The vertical stripe represents the most recent recommended value for G (black line) 
with its error bar (gray). Far to the right are the two outlying BIPM measurements, in blue.
Taken from \url{https://www.nist.gov/image/glabel2016plotfromstephanpng}}
\end{center}

The recommended value is ${\cal G}=6.67430(15)\cdot 10^{-11} \si{\cubic\meter\per\kg\per\square\second}$, 
see for instance \url{https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bg}.

%---------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Multipole expansion}

The idea behind the multipole expansion is simple: the denominator in Eq.~\eqref{grav_potential}
can be rewritten in such a way that it can be expanded as a Taylor series. 
We have 
\[
\frac{1}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}'|} 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (\vec{r}-\vec{r}') \cdot (\vec{r}-\vec{r}')   }}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \vec{r}\cdot\vec{r} - 2 \vec{r}\cdot \vec{r}' + \vec{r}'\cdot \vec{r}'   }}
= \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1 - 2 \frac{\vec{r}\cdot \vec{r}'}{r^2} + \left(\frac{r'}{r} \right)^2   }}
\]

The potential can be expanded in a series of Legendre polynomials. 
\[
(1-2XZ+Z^2)^{-1/2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty Z^n P_n(X)
\]
valid for $|X|\le 1$ and $|Z|\le q$. The coefficients $P_n$ are the Legendre polynomials of degree $n$.


FINISH!

%---------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Gravitational potential energy}


For two pairwise interacting point particles, the gravitational potential energy ${\cal U}$
is given by 
\[
{\cal U} = \frac{-{\cal G} Mm}{R}
\]
where $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the two particles, $R$ is the distance between them.
Close to the Earth's surface, the gravitational field is approximately constant, and the gravitational potential energy of an object reduces to
\[
{\cal U} = m g h 
\]
where $m$ is the object's mass, $g = {\cal G} M_E/ R_E^2$ 
is the gravity of Earth, and $h$ is the height of the object's center of mass above a chosen reference level.







%---------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Let us talk units}
 
The SI units for (gravity) acceleration are $\si{\metre\per\square\second}$.
However in the context of gravity, we will rarely encounter these.

The Gal is the commonly used unit in gravimetry:
\[
0.01 \si{\metre\per\square\second} = 1 {\rm Gal}
\]
and often measurements are given in mGal or $\mu$Gal.

As such, the acceleration due to Earth's gravity 
at its surface is 976 to 983 Gal, the variation being due 
mainly to differences in latitude and elevation. 


%---------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Gravity Force Inside a Spherical Shell}


%from wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem

In classical mechanics, the {\it shell theorem} gives 
gravitational simplifications that can be applied to objects inside or outside a 
{\it spherically symmetrical} body. 

Isaac Newton proved the shell theorem and stated that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre.
\item If the body is a spherically symmetric shell (i.e., a hollow ball), no net gravitational force is exerted by the shell on any object inside, regardless of the object's location within the shell.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/gravity/drawing}
\end{center}

These two propositions are not easy to prove. The second one is very important: it states
that if I stand mid-mantle at a radius of, say, 5000\si{\kilo\metre}, the 1371\si{\kilo\metre}-thick 
shell of rock above me does not contribute to the force of gravity that I am feeling. 
Only the rocks below my feet contribute to this force.
At this location we can write
\[
\frac{{\cal G}m M(r)}{r^2} = m a
\]
where $M(r)$ is the mass inside a sphere of radius $r$. The mass $m$ of my body cancels out, and we
obtain 
\[
\frac{{\cal G} M(r)}{r^2} = a
\]
The acceleration in this context is often called $g$ and it clearly depends on $r$ so that 
if density is constant, $M(r)=\frac{4\pi}{3}r^3\rho_0$ and then 
\[
g(r) = {\cal G} \frac{4\pi}{3}r\rho_0
\]
It also follows that the gravity acceleration in the center of the planet ($r=0$) must be zero and 
the gravity acceleration increases linearly with the distance to the center. 
If now the density is not constant (but radially symmetric, i.e. $\rho=\rho(r)$) then 
\[
g(r) =  {\cal G} \frac{4\pi}{r^2} \int_0^r \rho(r') r'^2 dr'
\]
Remember that this is true because of the spherical symmetry!

%---------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Nonuniqueness}

Given a body with mass $M$ at a distance $r$ from me, the gravitational acceleration 
that I feel is 
\[
a = \frac{{\cal G} M}{r^2}
\]
If the mass is now twice as far (distance $2r$) then 
\[
a' = \frac{{\cal G} M}{(2r)^2} =  \frac{1}{4} \frac{{\cal G} M}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4}a
\]
Because of the inverse square of the distance the acceleration is four times as small. 

However, if I now 'make' the mass of the body four times as large and twice as far, 
\[
a'' = \frac{{\cal G} (4M)}{(2r)^2} = \frac{{\cal G} M}{r^2} =a
\]
There lies a very important fact: There is an inescapabale trade-off between distance 
and mass. 

If gravity is measured at a single point in space nothing certain can be said about 
what lies below: the object generating the gravity anomaly could be 'close' and 
not so massive, or 'far' and really massive, 
both situations potentially leading to the same measurement.

As explained in \textcite{crdv02} (2002),  
in The Netherlands gravity values
increase from south to north with about 1 milligal per kilometer. Smallest values occur
in Limburg (981,100 milligal), while the largest values occur in Groningen (981,350
milligal). Local variations are limited to 1 milligal over some kilometers.

this yields a negative Bouguer anomaly. A mass excess exists where the stratigraphic succession is 
composed of relatively heavy rocks, this yields a positive anomaly.

  Check the dimensional units in (\ref{poisson_eqn})
  and verify that the gravitational potential has the dimension of 
  energy per unit mass.
  This is in agreement with the identification of the gravity potential
  with the potential (gravitational) energy of a unit mass in the
  gravity field.
\footnote{
  The local potential field value $U({\bf r}_1)$ equals the negative of
  the (gravitational) potential energy $W({\bf r}_1)$

  It can be shown that the change in potential energy $\Delta W$

The work done by moving a unit point mass from a location
${\bf r}_1$ to
${\bf r}_2$ is defined by the line integral,
\begin{eqnarray}
   \Delta W 
   &=& 
     \int_{{\bf r}_1}^{{\bf r}_2}
               {\bf F} \cdot d{\bf r}
    = 
     \int_{{\bf r}_1}^{{\bf r}_2}
               {\bf g} \cdot d{\bf r}
    = 
     \int_{{\bf r}_1}^{{\bf r}_2}
             - \vec\nabla U \cdot d{\bf r}
    = 
     \int_{U({\bf r}_1)}^{U({\bf r}_2)} - dU
%%%           \nonumber \\
    = 
      -\left ( U({\bf r}_2) - U({\bf r}_1) \right ) = - \Delta U
\label{work-integral}
\end{eqnarray}
Here the following gradient property has been used, 
relating the gradient vector to the differential of the scalar 
potential field,
\begin{equation}
   dU
    =
   \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} dx + 
   \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} dy + 
   \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} dz
    =
   \vec\nabla U \cdot d{\vec r} 
\end{equation}
The gravitational potential field can thus be defined in terms of the
work done by the gravity field to move a unit mass from infinity 
to the evaluation point.
\begin{equation}
   W({\bf r}_1) 
    =
    \int_{{\bf r}_\infty}^{{\bf r}_1}
     {\bf g} \cdot d{\bf r}
    =
    \int_{{\bf r}_\infty}^{{\bf r}_1}
     -\vec\nabla U \cdot d{\bf r}
    =
    \int_{U({\bf r}_\infty)}^{U({\bf r}_1)}
     -dU
    =
     - U({\bf r}_1) + U({\bf r}_\infty) = - U({\bf r}_1)
\end{equation}
Where $U({\bf r}_\infty) = 0$ has been used.

The above can be applied in the 
determination of the escape velocity from the
surface of a planet. 
This is the minimum launch velocity to escape from the planet's gravity
field. 
For a spherically symmetric planet the external gravity potential is
given by (\ref{grav_field_unif_sphere}).
Moving an object from the surface, the gravity potential changes 
by $\Delta U = U(r) - U(R) = {\cal G} M(-\frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{R})$.
Applying an energy conservation argument we require the change
in total (potential plus kinetic) energy per unit mass to be:
$\Delta E= \Delta U + \Delta K = 0$. 
With $\Delta K = - v_{ex}^2 /2$ we get $v_{esc} = \sqrt{2{\cal G}M/R}$.

The gravitational energy considered above plays an important role
in major compositional differentiation processes that occurred 
in the early Earth and are still occuring today.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A so called `core catastrophe' occured when
  the iron/nickel core of the Earth differentiated from the silicate mantle
  in the first few million years after the formation of the Earth
  in the early solar system.
  This event has probably freed enough potential energy to melt the mantle 
  completely, resulting in a global magma ocean \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron\_catastrophe}.
\item
  Crystallization of the solid inner core from the liquid outer core,
  as a result of core cooling,
  is accompanied by compositional differentiation. 
  The liquid outer core contains a lighter fraction, possibly sulfur,
  which stays behind in the liquid during freezing of the inner
  core.
  The enriched residual liquid near the inner core boundary is less
  dense than the average liquid of the outer core and this results
  in a gravitationally unstable layering that induces
  `chemically driven' convective flow in the outer core.
  The potential energy released in this chemical convection is 
  probably an important energy source in powering the geodynamo
  that generates the Earth's present day magnetic field.
\end{itemize}
