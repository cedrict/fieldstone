This format seems to be the universally accepted format for 2D and 3D visualisation in 
Computational Geodynamics (and even CFD ?). Such files can be opened with open source 
softwares such as 
Paraview \footnote{https://www.paraview.org/}, 
MayaVi \footnote{https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/}
or Visit \footnote{https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/}.

Unfortunately it is my experience that no simple tutorial exists about how to build 
such files. There is an official document which describes the vtk 
format\footnote{https://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf}
but it delivers the information in a convoluted way\footnote{I only later realised
it was also limited!}. I therefore describe hereafter 
how fieldstone builds the vtk/vtu files\footnote{I have found the following
information about vtk vs. vtu: VTK denotes the simple legacy format file.
VTU denotes a Serial Unstructured Grid format information for the XML-based syntax.}. 

I hereunder show vtk file corresponding to a $3\times 2$ grid made of linear elements.
In this particular example there are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12 nodes and 6 elements
\item 1 elemental field (the pressure {\python p})
\item 2 nodal fields: 1 scalar (the smoothed pressure {\python q}), 
1 vector (the velocity field {\python u,v,0})
\end{itemize}
Note that vtk files are inherently 3D so that even in the case of 
a 2D simulation the $z$-coordinate 
of the points and for instance their $z$-velocity component must be provided.
The file, usually called {\filenamefont solution.vtk} starts with a header:

\lstinputlisting[language=python,firstline=1,lastline=3]{images/vtk/solution.vtu}

We then proceed to write the node coordinates as follows:

\lstinputlisting[language=python,firstline=4,lastline=19]{images/vtk/solution.vtu}

These are followed by the elemental field(s):

\lstinputlisting[language=python,firstline=20,lastline=29]{images/vtk/solution.vtu}

Nodal quantities are written next:

\lstinputlisting[language=python,firstline=30,lastline=59]{images/vtk/solution.vtu}

To these informations we must append 3 more datasets. The first one is the connectivity, 
the second one is the offsets and the third one is the type. The first one is trivial
since the required connectivity array is the same as the one needed for the Finite Elements. 
The second must be understood as follows:
when reading the connectivity information in a linear manner the offset values 
indicate the beginning of each element (omitting the zero value). The third is simply the type of element 
as given in the vtk format document (9 corresponds to a generic quadrilateral with an 
internal numbering consistent with ours - more on this later). 

\lstinputlisting[language=python,firstline=60,lastline=85]{images/vtk/solution.vtu}

The file is then closed with

\lstinputlisting[language=python,firstline=86,lastline=88]{images/vtk/solution.vtu}

The {\sl solution.vtu}\footnote{\url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedrict/fieldstone/master/images/vtk/solution.vtu}}  
can then be opened with ParaView, MayaVi or Visit and the reader 
is advised to find tutorials online on how to install and use these softwares. Also check Appendix~\ref{app:paraview} on how to use ParaView.

In the same folder {\tt images/vtk} there is the python script 
{\pythonfile makevtu.py}\footnote{\url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cedrict/fieldstone/master/images/vtk/makevtu.py}} 
which produces 3 different vtu files. The first one {\sl solution1.vtu} is a 
similar to the one above: an {\python nelx*nely} quadrilateral-based mesh in a unit square. 
The second one ({\sl solution2.vtu}) looks identical when opened in Paraview but 
it is rather different: each element is exported as its own sub-mesh, so that if 
the mesh counts {\python nel} elements the number of vertices is 
{\python 4*nel}, and not {\python (nelx+1)*(nely+1)}. 
As such this file is larger. The icon array is needed to write down the positions of 
the four vertices of each element but not to write down the connectivity 
since the first 4 points are making the 1st element, 
the next four points are making the second element, etc ...

\begin{lstlisting}
vtufile.write("<Points> \n")
vtufile.write("<DataArray type='Float32' NumberOfComponents='3' Format='ascii'> \n")
for iel in range(0,nel):
    if not flag[iel]:
       for k in range(0,m):
           vtufile.write("%10e %10e %10e \n" %(x[icon[k,iel]],y[icon[k,iel]],0.))
vtufile.write("</DataArray>\n")
vtufile.write("</Points> \n")
vtufile.write("<Cells>\n")
vtufile.write("<DataArray type='Int32' Name='connectivity' Format='ascii'> \n")
for iel in range (0,nel_left):
    vtufile.write("%d %d %d %d \n" %(iel*4,iel*4+1,iel*4+2,iel*4+3))
vtufile.write("</DataArray>\n")
...
vtufile.write("</Cells>\n")
\end{lstlisting}

This format is rather practical in the case of linear or higher order 
discontinuous fields. For example, in the case of the $Q_2\times P_{-1}$ 
element pair, the pressure is linear inside each element and discontinuous 
across element edges. One can then assign pressure values at the four 
vertices of each element. 

Finally a third mesh {\sl solution3.vtu} is produced. It is based on the 
2nd one, but since elements are now somewhat de-coupled, then one can export 
only a subset of the mesh. For instance one could not show elements which 
are too distorted, or below a certain line, or outside a certain volume, etc ... 
In {\pythonfile makevtu.py} all elements whose center is inside a circle 
are flagged and will not be exported into the vtu file:
\begin{lstlisting}
for iel in range(0,nel):
    flag[iel]= (xc[iel]-0.333*Lx)**2+(yc[iel]-0.666*Ly)**2<0.234**2
nel_flagged=np.sum(flag)
nel_left=nel-nel_flagged
\end{lstlisting}

Once opened in ParaView this is how it looks like:

We can find at this address\footnote{\url{https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/vtkCellType_8h_source.html}} 
a list of supported cell types (although their internal numbering is not mentioned so 
enjoy the guess work).
Here is a subset of these that can be relevant in our case:
\begin{verbatim}
   // Linear cells
   VTK_EMPTY_CELL = 0,
   VTK_VERTEX = 1,
   VTK_POLY_VERTEX = 2,
   VTK_LINE = 3,
   VTK_POLY_LINE = 4,
   VTK_TRIANGLE = 5,
   VTK_TRIANGLE_STRIP = 6,
   VTK_POLYGON = 7,
   VTK_PIXEL = 8,
   VTK_QUAD = 9,
   VTK_TETRA = 10,
   VTK_VOXEL = 11,
   VTK_HEXAHEDRON = 12,
   VTK_WEDGE = 13,
   VTK_PYRAMID = 14,
   VTK_PENTAGONAL_PRISM = 15,
   VTK_HEXAGONAL_PRISM = 16,
   // Quadratic, isoparametric cells
   VTK_QUADRATIC_EDGE = 21,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_TRIANGLE = 22,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_QUAD = 23,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_POLYGON = 36,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_TETRA = 24,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_HEXAHEDRON = 25,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_WEDGE = 26,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_PYRAMID = 27,
   VTK_BIQUADRATIC_QUAD = 28,
   VTK_TRIQUADRATIC_HEXAHEDRON = 29,
   VTK_TRIQUADRATIC_PYRAMID = 37,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_LINEAR_QUAD = 30,
   VTK_QUADRATIC_LINEAR_WEDGE = 31,
   VTK_BIQUADRATIC_QUADRATIC_WEDGE = 32,
   VTK_BIQUADRATIC_QUADRATIC_HEXAHEDRON = 33,
   VTK_BIQUADRATIC_TRIANGLE = 34,
   // Cubic, isoparametric cell
   VTK_CUBIC_LINE = 35,
\end{verbatim}

After some online searching I found this figure\footnote{{https://examples.vtk.org/site/Cxx/GeometricObjects/IsoparametricCellsDemo/}}:

Fortunately these cell types seem to coincide with those in this document
\footnote{https://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf}
mentioned earlier where we find these schematics:
