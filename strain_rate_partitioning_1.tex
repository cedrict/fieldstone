Each is subjected to the same stress $\tau$ but deforms 
with its own strain rate $\dot{\varepsilon}_1$ and $\dot{\varepsilon}_2$ and we have 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\varepsilon}_T 
= \dot{\varepsilon}_1 + \dot{\varepsilon}_2
= \frac{\tau}{2\eta_1} + \frac{\tau}{2\eta_2}
\end{equation}
The effective viscosity of this combination is denoted $\eta_{eff}$ and is such that 
$\eta_{eff}=\tau/2\dot{\varepsilon}_T$, which means that 
\[
\frac{\tau}{2\eta_{eff}} = \frac{\tau}{2\eta_1} + \frac{\tau}{2\eta_2}
\]
or, 
\[
\eta_{eff}= \left( \frac{1}{\eta_1} + \frac{1}{\eta_2} \right)^{-1}
\]
i.e. it follows that the effective viscosity of two or more viscous dampers in series is the harmonic 
average of the individual viscosities of the dampers.

In general, for n dampers in series:
\[
\eta_{eff}= \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\eta_i} \right)^{-1}
\]
