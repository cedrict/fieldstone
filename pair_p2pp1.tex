This element pair is not to be mistaken for the Crouzeix-Raviart. Both share the same $P_2^+$ space
for the velocity but this element has a continuous linear pressure.  
It is mentioned in Table~3.13-1 of \textcite{grsa}: ``LBB stable. Second order. cubic bubble. good element''.
It is also mentioned in \textcite{sofo87} (1987).

Implemented in \stone~120.
