The Consistent Boundary Flux technique was devised to 
alleviate the problem of the accuracy of primary variables 
derivatives (mainly velocity and temperature) on boundaries.
These derivatives are important since they are needed to compute
the heat flux (and therefore the Nusselt number) or 
dynamic topography and geoid. 

The idea was first introduced in \cite{mizu86} and later used 
in geodynamics \cite{zhgh93}. It was finally implemented 
in the CitcomS code \cite{zhmt08} and more recently
in the ASPECT code (dynamic topography postprocessor).
Note that the CBF should be seen as a post-processor step 
as it does not alter the primary variables values.

The CBF method is implemented and used in Stone~\ref{f_49}.
It is also discussed but not explicitely named in \cite[p309]{reddybook2}.
Also see \cite{lahe76,grls87,mahz78}.

%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The CBF applied to the Stokes equation}
We start from the strong form:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\vec \nabla}\cdot {\bm \sigma} + {\vec b} &=& {\vec 0} 
\end{eqnarray}
and then write the weak form on an element $e$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{\Omega_e} N_i^\upnu {\vec \nabla}\cdot {\bm \sigma} d\Omega + \int_{\Omega_e} N_i^\upnu  {\vec b} \; d\Omega 
&=& \vec 0 
\end{eqnarray}
We then use the two equations: \index{chain rule} \index{divergence theorem}
\[
\bm \nabla \cdot ( N  \bm \sigma ) = N \bm \nabla \cdot \bm \sigma + \bm \nabla N \cdot  \bm \sigma  
\qquad \text{(chain rule)}
\]
\[
\int_\Omega (\bm \nabla \cdot {\bm \sigma} )\; dV = \int_\Gamma {\bm \sigma} \cdot \bm n \; dS
\qquad \text{(divergence theorem)}
\]
and integrate by parts in order to obtain:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_\Gamma N_i^\upnu {\bm \sigma}\cdot{\bm n} dS - 
\int_{\Omega_e} {\vec \nabla } N_i^\upnu \cdot {\bm \sigma} d\Omega + \int_{\Omega_e} N_i^\upnu  {\vec b} d\Omega =\vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}
and since the traction vector ${\vec t}$ is given by $\vec{t}={\bm \sigma}\cdot{\bm n}$ we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{\Gamma_e}  N_i^\upnu {\bm t} dS 
&=& \int_{\Omega_e} {\vec \nabla } N_i^\upnu \cdot {\bm \sigma}\; d\Omega 
- \int_{\Omega_e} N_i^\upnu  {\vec b} \; d\Omega   \label{eq:cbf1}
\end{eqnarray}
The core idea of the method lies in considering the traction vector as an unknown 
living on the nodes on the boundary, and assuming we have already solved the Stokes 
equation and therefore have obtained the velocity and pressure.

Finally, since the traction vector can be expressed as a function of the velocity 
shape functions on the edgem i.e.
\[
\vec{t} = \sum_{i=1}^m N_i^\upnu \vec{t}_i
\]
the left hand term yields an edge (1D) mass matrix $M'$ (see Section~\ref{app:mm}).

\begin{remark}
In Stone~\ref{f_27} an alternative to equation \ref{eq:cbf1} is used. Although
somewhat inefficient, the elemental matrices $\K$ and $\G$ and the corresponding 
body force rhs are built and the rhs of the traction equation is computed as follows:
\[
M' \cdot {\cal T} = -\K {\cal V} - \G {\cal P} + f
\]
where ${\cal T}$ is the vector of assembled tractions which we want to compute 
and ${\cal V}$ and ${\cal T}$ are the solutions of the Stokes problem. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} 
The assembled mass matrix is tri-diagonal and can be easily solved with 
a Conjugate Gradient method. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} 
With a trapezoidal integration rule 
(i.e. Gauss-Lobatto - see Section~\ref{sec:loba}) the matrix can even be diagonalised and the resulting 
matrix is simply diagonal, which results in a very cheap solve \cite{zhgh93}.
\end{remark}

%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The CBF applied to the heat transport equation}

We start from the strong form of the heat transfer equation (without the source terms for simplicity):
\[
\rho C_p
\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot \vec{\nabla}T\right)
=
\vec{\nabla} \cdot k\vec{\nabla T}
\]
The weak form then writes:
%\[
%\int_\Omega N
%\rho C_p
%\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + {\bm v}\cdot {\bm \nabla}T\right) dV
%=
%\int_\Omega N
%{\bm \nabla} \cdot k{\bm \nabla T} dV
%\]
\[
\int_\Omega N^\theta
\rho C_p
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} dV 
+
\rho C_p
\int_\Omega N^\theta
\vec{v}\cdot \vec{\nabla}T  dV
=
\int_\Omega N^\theta
\vec{\nabla} \cdot k\vec{\nabla} T dV
\]
Using once again integration by parts and divergence theorem:
\[
\int_\Omega N
\rho C_p
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} dV 
+
\rho C_p
\int_\Omega N
 {\bm v}\cdot {\bm \nabla}T  dV
=
\int_\Gamma N k {\bm \nabla T} \cdot {\bm n} d\Gamma
-
\int_\Omega  {\bm \nabla} N \cdot k{\bm \nabla T} dV
\]
On the boundary we are interested in the heat flux ${\bm q}=-k {\bm \nabla T}$
\[
\int_\Omega N
\rho C_p
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} dV 
+
\rho C_p
\int_\Omega N
 {\bm v}\cdot {\bm \nabla}T  dV
=
-\int_\Gamma N {\bm q} \cdot {\bm n} d\Gamma
- \int_\Omega  {\bm \nabla} N \cdot k{\bm \nabla T} dV
\]
or,
\[
\int_\Gamma N {\bm q} \cdot {\bm n} d\Gamma
=
-\int_\Omega N
\rho C_p
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} dV 
-\rho C_p
\int_\Omega N
 {\bm v}\cdot {\bm \nabla}T  dV
- \int_\Omega  {\bm \nabla} N \cdot k{\bm \nabla T} dV
\]
Considering the normal heat flux $q_n = {\bm q} \cdot {\bm n}$ as an unknown 
living on the nodes on the boundary, 
\[
q_n = \sum_{i=1}^2 q_{n|i} N_i
\]
so that the left hand term becomes a mass matrix for the shape functions living on 
the boundary.
We have already covered the right hand side terms when building the FE system 
to solve the heat transport equation, so that in the end 
\[
M' \cdot {\cal Q}_n =
- M \cdot \frac{\partial \bm T}{\partial t} -K_a \cdot {\bm T} - K_d \cdot {\bm T} 
\]
where ${\cal Q}_n$ is the assembled vector of normal heat flux components.
Note that in all terms the assembly only takes place over the elements along the boundary.


Note that the resulting matrix is symmetric.


\subsubsection{Some implementation details for the Stokes equation}

What follows is relevant for Stone~\ref{f_27} which relies on $Q_1$ shape 
functions for the velocity. 
Let us start with a small example, a 3x2 element FE grid:
\begin{center}

\end{tikzpicture}\\
{\tiny Red color corresponds to the dofs in the x direction, blue color indicates a dof in the y direction.}
\end{center}

We have nnp=12, nel=6, NfemV=24. Let us assume that free slip boundary conditions are applied. 
The boundary conditions {\tt fix\_bc} array is then:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%\draw[step=0.5cm,gray,very thin] (0,0) grid (9,0.7); %background grid
\node  at (0.45,.1) {\tiny bc\_fix=[};

\node[red]  at (1.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (1.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (1.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (1.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (2.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (2.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (2.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (2.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (3.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (3.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (3.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (3.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (4.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (4.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (4.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (4.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (5.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (5.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (5.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (5.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (6.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (6.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (6.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (6.75,.1) {\tiny T};

\node  at (7,.1) {\tiny ]};

\end{tikzpicture}\\
\end{center}
Note that since corners belong to two edges, we effectively prescribed 
no-slip boundary conditions on those. 
\todo[inline]{why does array contain only T??}


We wish to compute the tractions on the boundaries, and more precisely for the dofs for which 
a Dirichlet velocity boundary condition has been prescribed.
The number of (traction) unknowns NfemTr is then the number of {\tt T} in the {\tt bc\_fix} array.
In our specific case, we wave NfemTr= .
\todo{finish}
This means that we need for each targeted dof to be able to find its identity/number
between 0 and NfemTr-1. We therefore create the array {\tt bc\_nb} which is 
filled as follows: 
 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[step=0.5cm,gray,very thin] (0,0) grid (9,0.7); %background grid

\node  at (0.5,.1) {\tiny bc\_nb=[};

\node[red]  at (1.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (1.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (1.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (1.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (2.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (2.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (2.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (2.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (3.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (3.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (3.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (3.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (4.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (4.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (4.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (4.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (5.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (5.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (5.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (5.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (6.00,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (6.25,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[red]  at (6.50,.1) {\tiny T};
\node[blue] at (6.75,.1) {\tiny T};
\node  at (7,.1) {\tiny ]};
\end{tikzpicture}\\
\end{center}

This translates as follows in the code:
\begin{lstlisting}
NfemTr=np.sum(bc_fix)
bc_nb=np.zeros(NfemV,dtype=np.int32)
counter=0
for i in range(0,NfemV):
    if (bc_fix[i]):
       bc_nb[i]=counter
       counter+=1
\end{lstlisting}


The algorithm is then as follows

\begin{itemize}
\item[A] Prepare two arrays to store the matrix $M_{cbf}$ and its right hand side $rhs_{cbf}$  

\item[B] 
Loop over all elements 

\item[C] 
For each element touching a boundary, compute the residual vector 
$R_{el}=-f_{el} + \K_{el}{\cal V}_{el} + \G_{el} {\cal P}_{el}$

\item[D]
Loop over the four edges of the element using the connectivity array

\item[E]
For each edge loop over the number of degrees of freedom (2 in 2D)

\item[F] 
For each edge assess whether the dofs on both ends are target dofs. 

\item[G]
If so, compute the mass matrix $M_{edge}$ for this edge 

\item[H] extract the 2 values off the element residual vector and assemble these
in $rhs_{cbf}$

\item[I] Assemble $M_{edge}$ into NfemTrxNfemTr matrix using bc\_nb
\end{itemize}
