In \textcite{cakp15} (2015) we find: 
\begin{displayquote}
{\color{darkgray}
The BR-FEM after Bernardi and Raugel \cite{bera85} 
is a modification of the $P_2\times P_0$ FEM. 
It is sometimes also called reduced $P_2\times P_0$ FEM.}
\end{displayquote}
They also state that this element also exists in 3D.

It is also mentioned in \textcite{bobf13} although it seems it is there called the SMALL element (p474).

In Lederer: "Consider the case d = 2. [...] we only need to control 
the normal velocity at the edge, i.e. adding the
edge bubble for both components of the velocity seems to be sub optimal (with respect to
computational costs and the expected approximation properties). The idea now is to only
add the normal edge bubble."

According to \textcite{jolm17} (2017) (example 6.3), `` the velocity space in the Bernardi-Raugel
element consists of $P_1$ functions which are enriched with edge bubble functions''.
The authors also speak of 'reconstructing the test functions' and state: 
``the results of the method with reconstruction are generally more accurate.
In summary, the use of an appropriately reconstructed test function in the Bernardi–
Raugel pair of spaces led to a clear improvement of the accuracy of the computed
results compared with the standard method.''

In \cite{befh21} the authors use the so-called Extended Bernardi-Raugel (EBR) element
which they call $(P_1 + B_3^F)^3 - P_0$ ``which is a cheap and stable pairing with few degrees of
freedom (DOFs) per cell''.

In \textcite{john16} we read: {\color{darkgray} ``The pair 
${\bm P}_1^{BR} \times P_0$ is used only occasionally for academic purposes.
It is remarked in \textcite{bera85} that both, the construction of the velocity
space and the proof of the inf-sup condition, can be extended to regular families
of triangulations consisting of quadrilaterals. This result was used in proving the
discrete inf-sup condition for spaces with discontinuous pressure on quadrilateral
grids.''}.

In \textcite{zhan23} we read: 
{\color{darkgray} ``
The Bernardi–Raugel finite element is a bubble enriched P1 -P0 finite element for the
Stokes equations, where three P2 edge-bubbles and four P3 face-bubbles are added to
the P1 velocity space on each triangle and each tetrahedron respectively. In the new
macro-bubble enriched finite element method, the velocity space is also enriched by
three P2 but multi-piece bubbles on each triangle. The divergence of such a P2 bubble
function is not a piecewise P1 function but a one-piece P0 function on the triangle. In
3D, four P1 macro-bubbles are added to the P1 velocity space where the divergence
of such a macro-bubble function is also a one-piece P0 function. The macro-bubble
enriched P1–P0 finite element is shown stable and quasi-optimal in solving the Stokes
equations.''}
