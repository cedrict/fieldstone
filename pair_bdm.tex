This element is mentioned in Kanschat book \cite{kanschat}, section 4.2.14. 
It also exists for quads see section 4.2.39 in the same book.
It is mentioned in \textcite{chen93a} (1993), also check the book by \textcite{brfo}.
It is well described in \textcite{kanschat17}.
There is an entire chapter (14) of \textcite{ergu21_72} dedicated to H(div) and 
section 14.5.1 to BDM elements. 
Check section 4.1.1 of \cite{aubb17} for triangles and quads.

\item In \textcite{lomw12} we read:

The Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element was introduced by Brezzi, Douglas and Marini in two dimensions 
(for triangles) in \textcite{brdm85} (1985). The element can be viewed as an alternative to the
Raviart-Thomas element using a complete polynomial space. It was later extended to three 
dimensions (tetrahedra, prisms and cubes) in \textcite{nede86} (1986) 
and \textcite{brdd87} (1987). The definition given
here is based on that of \textcite{nede86} (1986).

The Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element was introduced for mixed formulations of second-order elliptic 
equations. However, it is also useful for weakly symmetric discretizations of the elastic stress
tensor; see Farhloul and Fortin (1997); Arnold et al. (2007).

The dimension of $BDM_q$ is $(q+1)(q+2)$ for a triangle and $\frac12(q+1)(q+2)(q+3)$
for a tetrahedron.

Check book for definition.

A slight modification of the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element constrains the element space ${\cal V}$ by
only allowing normal components on the boundary of polynomial degree $q-1$ (rather than the full
polynomial degree $q$). Such an element was suggested on rectangles by \textcite{brdf87} (1987), and the
triangular analogue was given in \textcite{brfo}. In similar spirit, elements with differing
degrees on the boundary suitable for varying the polynomial degree between triangles were derived
in \textcite{brdm85b} (1985).

\item On the defelement website\footnote{\url{https://defelement.org/elements/brezzi-douglas-marini.html}}
we find a lot of information. Note that the mapping is set to 'contravariant Piola'. 
\todo[inline]{I still need to understand and write about this!}
It belongs to the categories 'Vector-valued elements', and 'H(div) conforming elements'

I reproduce below the figures and basis functions pertaining to the Degree 1 triangle, 
but the site also shows Degree 2 triangle, Degree 1 \& 2 tetrahedron, and so-called 
Lagrange variants.
