 This file contains 3 functions: 
 \subsubsection{compute\_dNdx\_dNdy\_dNdz.f90}

 This subroutine computes $\partial{\bN^\uptheta}/\partial x$ 
 and $\partial{\bN^\uptheta}/\partial y$  at a location $r,s$ passed as argument.
 \subsubsection{compute\_elemental\_matrix\_energy}
 This subroutine buils the elemental matrix ${\bm A}_{el}$ and its corresponding 
 right hand side $\vec{b}_{el}$. 
 \subsubsection{compute\_elemental\_matrix\_stokes.f90}
 Note that when the material model is called directly on the quadrature points and 
 the penalty formulation is used then the viscosity at the reduced quadrature location 
 is obtained by taking the maximum viscosity value carried by the quadrature points of 
 the element. 
 \subsubsection{compute\_elemental\_rho\_eta\_vol}
 This subroutine computes the elemental volume, the average density and 
 viscosity using the values already stored on the quadrature points. 
 \subsubsection{compute\_gravity}

 \subsubsection{compute\_timestep}
 See Section~\ref{ss:cfl}.
 \subsubsection{impose\_boundary\_conditions\_energy}
 This routine takes as argument the elemental matrices and vectors Ael, Bel
 and applies the boundary conditions to them.
 \subsubsection{impose\_boundary\_conditions\_stokes}
 This subroutine modifies the elemental $\K$, $\G$ and $\C$ matrices as well as the 
 elemental rhs $f_{el}$ and $h_{el}$ and returns them modified after imposing
 velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions.
 \subsubsection{template}

 \subsubsection{interpolate\_onto\_nodes.f90}
 This subroutine interpolates the components of the strain rate tensor on the velocity nodes.
 \subsubsection{locate\_point}
 This file contains a few simple subroutines which deal with the localisation of a point 
 in the mesh. The {\tt locate\_point} subroutine receives the coordinates of a point as argument 
 and returns its reduced coordinates and the id of the element it sits in.
 It relies on 3 other subroutines ({\tt find\_ielx\_r}, {\tt find\_iely\_s}, {\tt find\_ielz\_t})
 which take as argument a coorinate (x,y,z) and return the corresponding reduced
 coordinate (r,s,t) and the integer coordinate (ielx,iely,ielz).
 \subsubsection{make\_matrix\_energy}
 This subroutine builds the linear system for the energy equation. 
 It loops over each element, builds its elemental matrix ${\bm A}_{el}$
 and right hand side $\vec{b}_{el}$, applies boundary conditions, 
 and assembles these into the global matrix csrA and the corresponding 
 right hand side rhs\_b. 
 \subsubsection{make\_matrix\_stokes.f90}
 This subroutine loops over all elements, build their elemental matrices and rhs, 
 apply the boundary conditions ont these elemental matrices, and then 
 assembles them in the global matrix, either in CSR or in MUMPS format.
 \subsubsection{matrix\_setup\_A}
 If the geometry is Cartesian then the number of nonzeros in the matrix and its sparsity 
 structures are computed in a very efficient way. 
 \subsubsection{matrix\_setup\_GT.f90}

 \subsubsection{matrix\_setup\_K}

 \subsubsection{matrix\_setup\_M}
 See Section~\ref{ss:symmcsrss}. 
 \subsubsection{output\_mesh.f90}
 This subroutine produces the {\filenamefont meshV.vtu} file which only 
 contains the corner nodes.
 \subsubsection{output\_qpoints}

 \subsubsection{output\_solution}
 This subroutine generates the {\filenamefont solution.vtu} in the {\foldernamefont OUTPUT}
 folder. It also generates the basic ascii file {\filenamefont solution.ascii}
 \subsubsection{output\_swarm.f90}
 This subroutine produces the {\filenamefont swarm.vtu} file in the 
 {\foldernamefont OUTPUT} folder which contains the 
 swarm of particles with all their properties.
 \subsubsection{paint\_swarm}
 
 \subsubsection{pcg\_solver\_csr}
 The subroutine solves $A\cdot = b$ by means f the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method
 and the implementation follows algorithm 2.2 on page 82 of Elman, Silvester \&
 Wathen \cite{elsw}:
 
 Choose ${\vec u}^{(0)}$, compute ${\vec \phi}^{(0)}={\bm A}\cdot {\vec u}^{(0)}$ 
 then ${\vec r}^{(0)}={\vec f}-{\vec \phi}^{(0)}$, 
 ${\vec z}^{(0)}={\bm M}^{-1}\cdot {\vec r}^{(0)}$ and set ${\vec p}^{(0)}={\vec z}^{(0)}$.
 
 For $k=0$ until convergence do
 \begin{itemize}
 \item ${\vec \phi}^{(k)}={\bm A}\cdot {\vec p}^{(k)}$
 \item compute $\alpha_k = <{\vec z}^{(k)},{\vec r}^{(k)}>/<{\vec \phi}^{(k)},{\vec p}^{(k)}>$
 \item ${\vec u}^{(k+1)}={\vec u}^{(k)}+\alpha_k {\vec p}^{(k)}$
 \item ${\vec r}^{(k+1)}={\vec r}^{(k)}-\alpha_k{\vec \phi}^{(k)}$
 \item test for convergence
 \item ${\vec z}^{(k+1)}=M^{-1} {\vec r}^{(k+1)}$
 \item $\beta_k= <{\vec z}^{(k+1)},{\vec r}^{(k+1)}>/<{\vec z}^{(k)},{\vec r}^{(k)}>$
 \item ${\vec p}^{(k+1)}={\vec z}^{(k+1)}+\beta_k {\vec p}^{(k)}$
 \end{itemize}
 The convergence test is $\| \vec{r}_{k+1} \|_2/ \| \vec{r}_{k+1} \|_2 < tol$, 
 the maximum number of iterations is set to 1000, and the relative tolerance to $tol=10^{-6}$.
 Since the preconditioned is the diagonal of the ${\bm A}$ matrix, then the inverse of 
 ${\bm M}$ is trivial to compute/apply. 
 \subsubsection{postprocessors.f90}
 This subroutine computes the root mean square velocity
 and each of the average velocity components. It also 
 computes the volume using GLQ.
 \subsubsection{prescribe\_stokes\_solution.f90}
 This subroutine prescribes the velocity, pressure, temperature and strain rate components
 on the corners of each element via the {\sl analytical\_solution} subroutine.
 \subsubsection{quadrature\_setup.f90}
 This subroutine allocates all GLQ-related arrays for each element.
 It further computes the real $(x_q,y_q,z_q)$ and reduced $(r_q,s_q,t_q)$
 coordinates of the GLQ points, and assigns them their weights.
 \subsubsection{recover\_pressure\_penalty}
 This is scheme 4 in Section~\ref{psmoothing} (see \stone~12) which was proven to be 
 very cheap and very accurate. 
 The viscosity at the reduced quadrature location 
 is obtained by taking the maximum viscosity value carried by the quadrature points of 
 the element.

 \subsubsection{set\_global\_parameters\_pair}

 \subsubsection{setup\_cartesian2D.f90}

 and temperature nodes, the velocity, pressure and temperature connectivity arrays,
 the coordinates of its center (xc,yc), its integer coordinates (ielx, iely),
 and its dimensions (hx,hy).

 and temperature nodes, the velocity, pressure and temperature connectivity arrays,
 the coordinates of its center (xc,yc,zc), its integer coordinates (ielx,iely,ielz),

 implicit passed as argument via the module but the rhs and the guess vector are
