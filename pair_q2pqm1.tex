This element pair is mentioned in \textcite{caod86} (1986).
One can introduce the bubble function
$b(r,s)=(1-r^2)(1-s^2)$ and consider velocity approximations of the form
\[
u_h(r,s) = \sum_{i=1}^9 \bN_i (r,s) u_i + a_1 s b(r,s)
\]
\[
v_h(r,s) = \sum_{i=1}^9 \bN_i (r,s) v_i + a_2 r b(r,s)
\]
Using these expressions we can obtain a relationship between $a_1$
and $a_2$ such that the element is stable.
