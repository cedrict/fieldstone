This pair is not stable. In general ${\bm P}_k \times P_{-(k-1)}$ is not stable. 
Note that \textcite{zhan24} proposes a solution to this problem:
\begin{displayquote}
{\color{darkgray}
We show that the discrete velocity solution converges at
the optimal order when solving the steady state Stokes
equations by the ${\bm P}_k\times P_{-(k-1)}$ mixed finite element method for
$k \ge 4$ on 2D triangular grids or $k \ge 6$ on tetrahedral grids,
even in the case the inf-sup condition fails. By a simple
$L_2$-projection of the discrete $P_{k-1}$ pressure to the space of
continuous $P_{k-1}$ polynomials, we show this post-processed
pressure solution also converges at the optimal order. Both
2D and 3D numerical tests are presented, verifying the
theory.
