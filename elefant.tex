\newpage

This version on \elefant is different than the one I built from 2012 until 2018.
It incorporates many features and contains many identical algorithms with the original 
one but in a more streamlined version. Also the number of (outer) solver types, marker projections, 
element types, geometries, etc ... has been greatly reduced. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{images/elefant/logo_elefant_small}
\end{center}

This code is in Fortran because a) this is the language I know best; b) it is (really) fast;
c) the interface with MUMPS is seamless.

\section{The physics}

\begin{align}
-\vec\nabla \cdot \left[ 2\eta \left(\dot\varepsilon(\vec \upnu) 
-\frac{1}{3}(\vec\nabla \cdot \vec{\upnu}) \mathbf 1\right) \right] + \vec\nabla p &=  \rho \vec{g}
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \\  
  \vec\nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{\upnu}) &= 0
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$}
\end{align}
The second equation can be rewritten 
$\vec\nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{\upnu}) =  \rho \vec\nabla \cdot \vec{\upnu} + \vec{\upnu} \cdot {\vec \nabla} \rho=0$
or, 
\[
\vec\nabla \cdot \vec{\upnu} + \frac{1}{\rho} \vec{\upnu} \cdot {\vec \nabla}\rho=0
\]
In the case of a compressible flow the strain rate tensor and the deviatoric strain rate tensor are no more equal (since ${\vec \nabla}\cdot{\vec\upnu} \neq 0$).
The deviatoric strainrate tensor is given by\footnote{See the ASPECT manual for a justification of the 3 value in the denominator in 2D and 3D.} 
\[
\dot{\bm \varepsilon}^d({\vec \upnu})=
\dot{\bm \varepsilon}({\vec \upnu})-\frac{1}{3} Tr(\dot{\bm \varepsilon}) {\bm 1}
=\dot{\bm \varepsilon}({\vec\upnu})-\frac{1}{3} ({\vec \nabla}\cdot{\vec\upnu}) {\bm 1}
\]
In that case:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\varepsilon}_{xx}^d 
&=& \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
-\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) 
= \frac{2}{3}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
-\frac{1}{3} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
%=
%\frac{2}{3} \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial x}\;  u_i 
%-\frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial y}\;  v_i 
\\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{yy}^d 
&=& \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
-\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) 
=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} 
+ \frac{2}{3} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} 
%=-\frac{1}{3}  \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial x}\;  u_i
%+ \frac{2}{3} \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial y}\;  v_i
\\
2\dot{\varepsilon}_{xy}^d 
&=& 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} 
+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} 
%= \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial y}\;  u_i
%+ \sum_{i=1}^4 \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial x}\;  v_i
\end{eqnarray}
and then 
\[
\dot{\bm \varepsilon}^d({\vec\upnu})
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{2}{3} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} -\frac{1}{3} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}  \\ \\
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}  &
-\frac{1}{3} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +\frac{2}{3} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} 
\end{array}
\right)
\]

From $\vec{\tau} = 2\eta \vec{\varepsilon}^d$ we arrive at:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\tau_{xx}\\
\tau_{yy}\\
\tau_{xy}\\
\end{array}
\right)
=
2\eta
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\varepsilon}_{xx}^d \\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{yy}^d \\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{xy}^d 
\end{array}
\right)
=2 \eta
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
2/3 & -1/3& 0 \\
-1/3 & 2/3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1/2 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \\ 
\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\ 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\! +\! \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \\
\end{array}
\right)
=
\eta
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
4/3 & -2/3& 0 \\
-2/3 & 4/3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \\ 
\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\ 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\! +\! \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\]
or, 
\[
\vec{\tau} = {\bm C}_\eta \cdot  {\bm B} \cdot \vec{\cal V}
\]


After linearisation, the density depends on temperature and pressure as follows:
\[
\rho(T,p) = \rho_0 \left((1 - \alpha(T-T_0) + \beta_T p \right)
\]
where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, also called 
thermal expansivity: 
\[
\alpha=-\frac{1}{\rho}\left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T} \right)_p
\]
$\alpha$ is the percentage increase in volume of a material per degree of temperature increase; the
subscript $p$ means that the pressure is held fixed.

$\beta_T$ is the isothermal compressibility of the fluid, which is given by 
\[
\beta_T = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{1}{\rho}\left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial P} \right)_T
\]
with $K$ the bulk modulus. 
%aspect manual
Values of $\beta_T=10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ Pa$^{-1}$ are reasonable for Earth's mantle, with values decreasing by about a
factor of 5 between the shallow lithosphere and core-mantle boundary.
This is the percentage increase in density per unit change in pressure at constant temperature.
Both the coefficient of thermal expansion and the isothermal compressibility can be obtained
from the equation of state.

The full set of equations we wish to solve is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
-\vec\nabla \cdot \left[2\eta \dot{\bm \varepsilon}^d({\vec\upnu}) \right] + \vec \nabla p &=& \rho_0 \left((1 - \alpha(T-T_0) + \beta_T p \right) {\vec g} \quad\quad \textrm{in $\Omega$}  \label{eq:stokes-1a_} \\
\vec\nabla \cdot {\vec\upnu} + \frac{1}{\rho} {\vec\upnu} \cdot {\vec \nabla}\rho&=&0 \quad\quad  \textrm{in $\Omega$}   \label{eq:stokes-2a_} \\
\rho C_p \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \vec{\upnu}\cdot \vec\nabla T\right) - \vec\nabla\cdot k\vec\nabla T   &=& 
  \rho H  +  2\eta \dot{\bm \varepsilon}^d : \dot{\bm \varepsilon}^d    +\alpha T \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+  \vec{\upnu} \cdot \vec\nabla p \right) 
\quad\quad   \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \label{eq:temperature_}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Discretisation - mixed formulation}


Unlike virtually all stones, we here do not assume that all node inside an element carry all components of the 
velocity (typically $u,v$ in 2D and $u,v,w$ in 3D).
The 2D velocity inside an element is then given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
u^h({\vec r}) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_u} \bN_i^u({\vec r})\;  u_i \\
v^h({\vec r}) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_v} \bN_i^v({\vec r})\;  v_i
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bN_i^u$ and $\bN_i^v$ are the polynomial basis functions for the $u$- and $v-$component of the velocity
respectively, and the summation runs over the $m_u$ and $m_v$, i.e. the corresponding velocity nodes composing the element.

A similar expression is used for pressure:
\begin{equation}
p^h({\vec r})=\sum_{i=1}^{m_p} \bN_i^p({\vec r}) \; p_i
\end{equation}


We have previously established that the strain rate vector $\vec{\dot \varepsilon}$ is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\dot\varepsilon}^h &=&
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial u^h}{\partial x} \\ \\
\frac{\partial v^h}{\partial y} \\ \\
\frac{\partial w^h}{\partial z} \\ \\
\frac{\partial u^h}{\partial y}\! +\! \frac{\partial v^h}{\partial x} \\ \\
\frac{\partial u^h}{\partial z}\! +\! \frac{\partial w^h}{\partial x} \\ \\

or, $\vec{\dot \varepsilon}={\bm B}\cdot \vec{\cal V}$ where ${\bm B}$ is the gradient

$m_{vel}=m_u + m_v + m_w$ and the vector $\vec{\cal V}$ is $m_{vel}$ long.

\newpage


We use a mixed formulation and therefore  
keep both velocity and pressure as unknowns. We end up having to solve 
the following system:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\K & \G+\W \\ \G^T+\Z & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{\cal V} \\ \vec{\cal P}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{f} \\ \vec{h}
\end{array}
\right)
\quad\quad
{\rm or,}
\quad\quad
\A \cdot \vec{X} = \vec{b}
\]
Where $\K$ is the stiffness matrix, $\G$ is the discrete gradient operator, 
$\G^T$ is the discrete divergence operator, $\vec{\cal V}$ the velocity vector, 
$\vec{\cal P}$ the pressure vector.
Note that the term $\Z{\cal V}$ derives from term ${\vec\upnu} \cdot {\vec \nabla} \rho$ in the continuity equation
and that the term $\W$ derives from the pressure dependence of the density.

 
{\bf Remark 1}: the terms $\Z\cdot \vec{\cal V}$ and $\W\cdot \vec{\cal P}$ are 
often put in the rhs (i.e. added to $\vec{f}$ or $\vec{h}$) so that 
the matrix $\A$ retains the same structure as in the incompressible case. This is indeed 
how it is implemented in \aspect, see also appendix A of \textcite{lezh08} (2008). 
This however requires more work since the rhs depends 
on the solution and some form of iterations is needed (in practice we arrive at the 
solution by outer iterations). 

{\bf Remark 2}: Very often the adiabatic heating term  
$\alpha T \left( \bm v \cdot \nabla p \right)$ is simplified as follows:
%aspect manual
If you assume the vertical component of the gradient of the dynamic pressure to be small compared to the
gradient of the total pressure (in other words, the gradient is dominated by the gradient of the hydrostatic
pressure), then $-\rho {\vec g} \simeq {\vec \nabla}p$ and then 
$\alpha T \left( \vec\upnu \cdot \vec\nabla p \right) \simeq  
-\alpha\rho T {\vec\upnu}\cdot{\vec g}$.

\subsection{Pressure Correction (PC)}

From the equation above we can write
\[
\K_{xx}\cdot\vec{\cal U} + \G_x \cdot \vec{P} 
= \underbrace{\vec{f}_x - \K_{xy} \cdot \vec{\cal V}}_{= \vec{\cal F}_x} 
\]
and
\[
\K_{yy}\cdot\vec{\cal V} + \G_y \cdot \vec{P} 
= \underbrace{\vec{f}_y - \K_{yx} \cdot \vec{\cal U}}_{= \vec{\cal F}_y} 
\]

[Taken from \cite{haeh93}] 
The PC algorithm is a direct finite element counterpart of the 
well-established SIMPLE algorithm. The SIMPLE algorithm and the steps
leading to its derivation are discussed in detail by Patankar CITE!

In the SIMPLE algorithm the velocities and pressures are assumed to 
be decomposed into primary and corrective components. As convergence 
is approached, the corrective components vanish and the primary 
components asymptote towards the final solution. The primary components 
of velocity are obtained from the solution of the momentum equations 
using the latest pressures and velocities. In general, the updated 
velocities will not satisfy continuity and when substituted in the 
discretized continuity equation will produce a non-zero residual. This residual
is used to drive an equation for the pressure correction $\Delta \vec{\cal P}$, which 
is obtained from manipulations of the discretized momentum and 
continuity equations. The pressure correction is consequently
used to update the pressure and to obtain the correction velocities 
which mass-adjust the velocity field to satisfy continuity. As the above 
sequence is repeated and convergence is approached, the
continuity equation is more closely satisfied which in turn leads to 
smaller pressure corrections and consequently smaller velocity corrections. 
At convergence the velocities and pressures
simultaneously satisfy the discretized momentum and continuity equations.
The implementation of our version of the SIMPLE algorithm may be summarized in the
following algorithmic steps:

Given an initial or guess solution field 
($\vec{\cal U}_0$, $\vec{\cal V}_0$, $\vec{\cal P}_0$), 
for i=0,1,2,3,... until convergence, the following steps should be taken:

\begin{enumerate}
\item solve SCPE for pressure correction $\Delta \vec{\cal P}$
\[
\left[
\G_x^T \cdot ( \tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_x
+
\G_y^T \cdot ( \tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_y
\right]
\cdot
\Delta \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2} 
= -\G_x^T \cdot \vec{\cal U}^i - \G_y^T \cdot \vec{\cal V}^i + \vec{g} 
\]

\item mass-adjust velocity field and increment pressure via

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\cal U}^{i+1/2} &=& \vec{\cal U}^i + (\tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot 
\G_x \cdot \Delta \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2} \\
\vec{\cal V}^{i+1/2} &=& \vec{\cal V}^i + (\tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot 
\G_y \cdot \Delta \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2} \\
\vec{\cal P}^{i+1} &=& \vec{\cal P}^i + (1-\alpha_p) \Delta \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2}
\end{eqnarray}

\item solve $x$-momentum equation for $\vec{\cal U}$
\[
\left[
\frac{\alpha_u}{1-\alpha_u} \tilde{\K}_{xx} + \K_{xx}
\right]^\star
\cdot
\vec{\cal U}^{i+1} = \vec{\cal F}_x^\star + \G_x \cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1}
+\frac{\alpha_u}{1-\alpha_u} \tilde{\K}_{xx}^\star\cdot \vec{\cal U}^{i+1/2}
\]
\item solve $y$-momentum equation for $\vec{\cal V}$
\[
\left[
\frac{\alpha_v}{1-\alpha_v} \tilde{\K}_{yy} + \K_{yy}
\right]^\star
\cdot
\vec{\cal V}^{i+1} = \vec{\cal F}_y^\star + \G_y \cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1}
+\frac{\alpha_v}{1-\alpha_v} \tilde{\K}_{yy}^\star\cdot \vec{\cal V}^{i+1/2}
\]
\end{enumerate}

In the above equations the superscripts $i$, $i+1/2$ and $i+1$ 
denote previous, intermediate and latest iterate levels, respectively, 
while the superscript $^\star$ denotes an expression involving latest
available field variables. The $\tilde{\K}$ matrices are some convenient 
approximation to their corresponding $\K$ matrices. These are used both 
for the construction of the SCPM for $\Delta \vec{\cal P}$, and on either side of
the momentum and energy equations to relax these equations. 
The exact definition of the R matrices are given in Remark 2.4 of the paper. 
Finally, the $\alpha$'s appearing in the above equations are
relaxation factors which assume values between 0 and 1; 
the former producing no relaxation and
latter producing infinite relaxation (i.e. no change in solution).

Note that in the original formulation temperature is also taken into account.

\subsection{Pressure Projection (PP)}

[Taken from \cite{haeh93}] 
The PP algorithm is a consistent finite element
counterpart of the SIMPLER algorithm. The important difference between this
version of the segregated algorithm and the correction version above 
is that the pressure is obtained directly from the solution of a SCPE. 
The algorithm comprises three main steps. At the
beginning of a given iteration, an approximation to the pressure is 
obtained from the solution of a SCPE using the latest available field 
variables. The various components of the momentum
equations and any other conservation equations present in the 
flow problem are then solved in
a sequential manner using the most recent field data. Finally, at 
the end of the algorithmic sequence the velocity field is mass-adjusted 
(i.e. forced to satisfy the discretized continuity
equation) via an irrotational projection onto a divergence-free sub-space. 
This last step, which is similar to a least-squares mass adjustment, 
requires the solution of a further SCPE system for
a pseudo-pressure $\vec{\cal P}^s$. The SIMPLER algorithm is known to have superior 
convergence characteristics compared to the SIMPLE algorithm.
The implementation of our version of the SIMPLER algorithm may be summarized in the
following algorithmic steps.

Given an initial or guess solution field 
($\vec{\cal U}_0$, $\vec{\cal V}_0$, $\vec{\cal P}_0$), 
for i=0,1,2,3,... until convergence, the following steps should be taken:

\begin{enumerate}
\item solve SCPE for pressure $\vec{\cal P}$ 

\[
\left[
\G_x^T \cdot ( \tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_x
+
\G_y^T \cdot ( \tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_y
\right]
\cdot
\vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2} 
= -\G_x^T \cdot (\tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot 
(\vec{\cal F}_x^\star - \K_{xx}^\star \cdot \vec{\cal U}^i)
  -\G_y^T \cdot (\tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot 
(\vec{\cal F}_y^\star - \K_{yy}^\star \cdot \vec{\cal V}^i)
+ \vec{g} 
\]

\item relax pressure via
\[
\vec{\cal P}^{i+1} = \alpha_p \vec{\cal P}^i + (1-\alpha_p) \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2}
\]

\item solve $x$-momentum equation for $\vec{\cal U}$
\[
\left[
\frac{\alpha_u}{1-\alpha_u} \tilde{\K}_{xx} + \K_{xx}
\right]^\star
\cdot
\vec{\cal U}^{i+1/2} = \vec{\cal F}_x^\star + \G_x \cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1}
+\frac{\alpha_u}{1-\alpha_u} \tilde{\K}_{xx}^\star\cdot \vec{\cal U}^{i}
\]

\item solve $y$-momentum equation for $\vec{\cal V}$,
\[
\left[
\frac{\alpha_v}{1-\alpha_v} \tilde{\K}_{yy} + \K_{yy}
\right]^\star
\cdot
\vec{\cal V}^{i+1/2} = \vec{\cal F}_y^\star + \G_y \cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1}
+\frac{\alpha_v}{1-\alpha_v} \tilde{\K}_{yy}^\star\cdot \vec{\cal V}^{i}
\]

\item solve SCPE for $\vec{\cal P}^s$
\[
\left[
\G_x^T \cdot ( \tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_x
+
\G_y^T \cdot ( \tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_y
\right]
\cdot
\vec{\cal P}^{s} 
= -\G_x^T \cdot \vec{\cal U}^{i+1/2} - \G_y^T \cdot \vec{\cal V}^{i+1/2} + \vec{g} 
\]

\item mass adjust velocity field via
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\cal U}^{i+1} &=& \vec{\cal U}^{i+1/2} 
+ (\tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_x \cdot \vec{\cal P}^s \\
\vec{\cal V}^{i+1} &=& \vec{\cal V}^{i+1/2} 
+ (\tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_y \cdot \vec{\cal P}^s 
\end{eqnarray}
\end{enumerate}

In the above equations the definition of the superscripts and 
$\tilde{\K}$ matrices is the same as in the PC algorithm.


%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Pressure update (PU)}

While in the PP and PC algorithms the incompressibility constraint 
was being satisfied via mass-adjusting the velocity field using a pressure
correction or pseudo-pressure field, in the PU algorithm continuity is 
satisfied through penalizing
the continuity equation on the right-hand side of the SCPE. 
We will not attempt its detailed
derivation here except to say that it was conceived from the notion 
of a pseudo-temporal approach applied to the momentum equations. 
The change in the momentum equations from one
iteration to the other is considered to be along some type of 
pseudo-time dimension which
advances at different rates in different physical locations of 
the discretized domain. In a real transient approach the mass matrix, 
multiplied by the inverse of the time step, appears on both
sides of the discretized momentum equations. In this pseudo-temporal 
approach the above product (i.e. mass matrix divided by $\Delta t$) is 
replaced by the $\tilde{\K}$ matrices. The pseudo-momentum
equations are not used directly to solve for velocities; rather they are 
employed to arrive at
a SCPE for pressure which contains on its right-hand side the 
discretized continuity equation at
both the current and the advanced iterate levels. Finally, the desired 
SCPE is obtained by
requiring that continuity be satisfied at the advanced iterate level.
The algorithmic steps involved in this version of the segregated 
algorithm are as follows.

Given an initial or guess solution field 
($\vec{\cal U}_0$, $\vec{\cal V}_0$, $\vec{\cal P}_0$), 
for i=0,1,2,3,... until convergence, the following steps should be taken:

\begin{enumerate}
\item solve SCPE for pressure $\vec{\cal P}$, 
\[
\left[
\G_x^T \cdot (\tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_x +
\G_y^T \cdot (\tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot \G_y 
\right]
\cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2}
= 
-\G_x^T \cdot (\tilde{\K}_{xx}^{-1})^\star \cdot 
(\vec{\cal F}^\star_x-\K_{xx}^\star \cdot \vec{\cal U}^i )
-\G_y^T \cdot (\tilde{\K}_{yy}^{-1})^\star \cdot 
(\vec{\cal F}^\star_y-\K_{yy}^\star \cdot \vec{\cal V}^i )
- \lambda_p ( \G_x^T \cdot \vec{\cal U}^i + \G_y^T \cdot \vec{\cal V}^i -\vec{g} )
\]

\item relax pressure via
\[
\vec{\cal P}^{i+1} = \alpha_p \vec{\cal P}^i + (1-\alpha_p) \vec{\cal P}^{i+1/2}
\] 
\item solve $x$-momentum equation for $\vec{\cal U}$,
\[
\left[
\frac{\alpha_u}{1-\alpha_u} \tilde{\K}_u + \K_u
\right]^\star \cdot 
\vec{\cal U}^{i+1}
= \vec{\cal F}_x^\star + \G_x \cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1}
+ \frac{\alpha_u}{1-\alpha_u} \tilde{K}_u^\star \cdot \vec{\cal U}^i
\]
 
\item solve $y$-momentum equation for $\vec{\cal V}$,
\[
\left[
\frac{\alpha_v}{1-\alpha_v} \tilde{\K}_v + \K_v
\right]^\star \cdot 
\vec{\cal V}^{i+1}
= \vec{\cal F}_y^\star + \G_y \cdot \vec{\cal P}^{i+1}
+ \frac{\alpha_v}{1-\alpha_v} \tilde{K}_v^\star \cdot \vec{\cal V}^i
\]

\end{enumerate}




The notation convention used in the above equations is the same as that 
used in the PC and PP algorithms above. However, note the appearance 
of the dimensionless coefficient $\lambda_p$, on the
right-hand side of the pressure equation. This may be thought of 
as a penalty parameter which
controls the penalization of the continuity constraint in the pressure 
equation. The value of $\lambda_p$,
should be chosen large enough to adequately enforce the continuity 
constraint. However, too
large a value may lead to large pressure perturbations and destabilize 
the convergence behaviour.
Our testing has shown the range $0.1 < \lambda_p <1$ 
to work well for most problems and we have
consequently adopted a default value of $\lambda_p=0.2$.

%------------------------------------------
\subsection{How to compute $\tilde{\K}$}

The $\tilde{\K}$ matrices in the above algorithms are diagonal 
matrices and are obtained from the
following expressions:
\[
(\tilde{\K}_{xx})_{ii} = \sum_e \sum_j | (\K_{xx})_{ij} |
\]
\[
(\tilde{\K}_{yy})_{ii} = \sum_e \sum_j | (\K_{yy})_{ij} |
\]
where $\sum_e$ denotes a sum or assembly of element-level contributions.

Since the abeove $\tilde{\K}$ matrices are diagonal, their inversion 
is trivial and inexpensive. As
a result the SCPMs appearing in the above algorithms are 
substantially less expensive to
construct and solve compared to the FCPM in equation (3b).

\subsection{Successive block overrelaxation (SBOR) method}

We start from 
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{R}(\vec{\cal U},\vec{\cal V},\vec{\cal W}) \\ 
\vec{S}(\vec{\cal U},\vec{\cal V},\vec{\cal W}) \\ 
\vec{T}(\vec{\cal U},\vec{\cal V},\vec{\cal W}) \\ 
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\K_{xx} & \K_{xy} & \K_{xz} \\
\K_{yx} & \K_{yy} & \K_{yz} \\
\K_{zx} & \K_{zy} & \K_{zz} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{\cal U}\\
\vec{\cal V}\\
\vec{\cal W}
\end{array}
\right)
-
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{f}_x\\
\vec{f}_y\\
\vec{f}_z
\end{array}
\right)
\]
As explained in \textcite{lefr87}:
the objective is to factor only $\K_{xx}$, $\K_{yy}$, and $\K_{zz}$
thus reducing the cost of Gaussian elimination. This is accomplished
by block Gauss-Seidel iteration of the form

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\cal U}_{i+1} 
&=& \vec{\cal U}_i + \omega \; \K_{xx}^{-1} \cdot \vec{R}(\vec{\cal U}_i,\vec{\cal V}_i,\vec{\cal W}_i) \\
\vec{\cal V}_{i+1} 
&=& \vec{\cal V}_{i} + \omega \; \K_{yy}^{-1} \cdot \vec{S}(\vec{\cal U}_{i+1},\vec{\cal V}_i,\vec{\cal W}_i) \\
\vec{\cal W}_{i+1} 
&=& \vec{\cal W}_{i} + \omega \; \K_{zz}^{-1} \cdot \vec{T}(\vec{\cal U}_{i+1},\vec{\cal V}_{i+1},\vec{\cal W}_i) 
\end{eqnarray}

where $\omega$ is the overrelaxation parameter. Therefore, this scheme represents a successive-block-overrelaxation
(SBOR) algorithm (Jennings, 1977, p. 202). This technique is similar to the nonlinear block iterative method presented
by Cooke and Blanchard (1977).
