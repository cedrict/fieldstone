- Raviart Thomas 0 RT0 \cite{rath77} ? mentioned/defined/drawn in 4.2.2 of 
Kanschat book. Also exist for quads see 4.2.37 
\textcite{hald03}: ``$P_1^\perp \times P_0$ symbol denotes an element with 
normal velocity nodes in the middle of each edge of the
triangulation [...]. This element, also called low order Raviart–Thomas element 
(Raviart and Thomas, 1977), is based on flux conservation on elements edges and 
the resulting scheme is very close to a finite volume scheme.''

Mentioned in \textcite{john16}, appendix B.3, example B.45: ``the normal component of v 
on each face is a constant. The normal component of functions from RT0 is
continuous across faces of the mesh cells.''
