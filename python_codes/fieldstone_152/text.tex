The goal here is to explore the influence of the mapping polynomial order and/or
the number of quadrature points on the accuracy of the solution of various benchmarks and test cases.
We will exclusively focus on annulus geometries in plane strain of 
shell geometries by means of an axisymmetric formulation.

Concretely, in this \stone we will explore the effect of:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolution via the number of elements in the radial direction: {\python nelr=2-32} (we automatically set {\python nelt=12*nelr})
\item the number of quadrature points per dimension: {\python nqperdim=2,3,4,5}
\item the polynomial order of the mapping: {\python mapping='Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'}
\end{itemize}
and we will monitor the computed area/volume, the root mean square velocity and the velocity and pressure errors.

After discretising the domain in {\python nel} elements, and having decided the FE
pair we want to use to solve the Stokes equations (in this case \QtwoQone), we end up 
having to compute elemental integrals such as 
\[
\K_e = \int_{\Omega_e} {\bm B}^T\cdot {\bm C}_\eta \cdot {\bm B} \; d\Omega
\]
where $\Omega_e$ denotes an element.
The way we carry out this integration is by means of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature
(see Section~\ref{MMM-sec:quadrature}), which 
forces us to carry out a change of variables from the original element $\Omega_e$ 
to the reference element $(r,s) \in [-1,1]\times [-1,1]$. For this we establish a mapping between both 
as explained in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:mappings}.
Basis functions $Q_{1,2,3,4}$ are defined in Section~\ref{MMM-sec:shpfct2d}.

From left to right: $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$ and $Q_4$. Rows of nodes are placed 
on concentric circles and columns of nodes are equidistant in $\theta$ space.} 
\end{center}

The code for this \stone is based on \stone~\ref{f21}.  
For each element we store the coordinates of these mapping points into two 
arrays:
\begin{lstlisting}
xmapping=np.zeros((X,nel),dtype=np.float64)
ymapping=np.zeros((X,nel),dtype=np.float64)
\end{lstlisting}
where {\python X} stands for the number of nodes for each mapping.

The reduced coordinates for the quadrature points are given by 
the Gauss-Legendre quadrature approach. The real coordinates of these points
is a function of the mapping used so that 
\begin{lstlisting}
for iel in range(0,nel):
    for kq in range(0,nqel):
        rq=qcoords_r[kq]
        sq=qcoords_s[kq]
        NNNV=NNN(rq,sq,mapping)
        xq=np.dot(NNNV[:],xmapping[:,iel])
        yq=np.dot(NNNV[:],ymapping[:,iel])
\end{lstlisting}
Likewise the Jacobian matrix is by definition a function of the chosen mapping 
so that 
\begin{lstlisting}
for iel in range(0,nel):
    for kq in range(0,nqel):
        rq=qcoords_r[kq]
        sq=qcoords_s[kq]
        dNNNVdr=dNNNdr(rq,sq,mapping)
        dNNNVds=dNNNds(rq,sq,mapping)
        jcb[0,0]=np.dot(dNNNVdr[:],xmapping[:,iel])
        jcb[0,1]=np.dot(dNNNVdr[:],ymapping[:,iel])
        jcb[1,0]=np.dot(dNNNVds[:],xmapping[:,iel])
        jcb[1,1]=np.dot(dNNNVds[:],ymapping[:,iel])
        jcob=np.linalg.det(jcb)
        jcbi=np.linalg.inv(jcb)
\end{lstlisting}

{\captionfont Layout of the quadrature points in element \#0 of the mesh. 
From left to right: {\python nqperdim=2,3,4,5}.} 
\end{center}

Note that the {\python axisymmetric} flag controls whether the Stokes equations 
are solved in plane strain or under the assumption that there is axisymmetry. 
In the latter case the mesh is a demi-annulus in the $x>0$ half plane.

Finally free slip boundary conditions have been implemented, but only at the 
surface, and only with the method of Lagrange Multipliers (\stone~\ref{f151}
taught us that it works as well as the other method).  
{\color{red} change}

\begin{eqnarray}
\K_e \cdot \vec{\cal V} + \G_e \cdot \vec{\cal P} &=& \vec{f}  \\
\G_e \cdot \vec{\cal V} &=& \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}
We multiply the first line by the rotation matrix ${\bm R}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bm R} \cdot \K_e \cdot \vec{\cal V} +{\bm R} \cdot \G_e \cdot \vec{\cal P} &=&{\bm R} \cdot \vec{f}  \\
\G_e \cdot \vec{\cal V} &=& \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}
and then introduce the identity matrix ${\bm I}={\bm R}^T\cdot {\bm R}$ before the velocity vector:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bm R} \cdot \K_e \cdot {\bm R}^T\cdot {\bm R} \cdot  \vec{\cal V} +{\bm R} \cdot \G_e \cdot \vec{\cal P} &=&{\bm R} \cdot \vec{f}  \\
\G_e \cdot  {\bm R}^T\cdot {\bm R} \cdot  \vec{\cal V} &=& \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}
The second line can also be written
\begin{eqnarray}
({\bm R} \cdot \K_e \cdot {\bm R}^T) \cdot ({\bm R} \cdot  \vec{\cal V}) + ({\bm R} \cdot \G_e) \cdot \vec{\cal P} &=&{\bm R} \cdot \vec{f}  \\
( {\bm R} \cdot \G_e)^T \cdot  ({\bm R} \cdot  \vec{\cal V}) &=& \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}
which translates at the elemental level into
\begin{lstlisting}
K_el=RotMat.dot(K_el.dot(RotMat.T))
f_el=RotMat.dot(f_el)
G_el=RotMat.dot(G_el)
\end{lstlisting}
Note that the matrix $\K_e$ is $(m*ndofV)\times (m*ndofV)$ in size, and so is the matrix ${\bm R}$.

After boundary conditions are imposed, the system is rotated back:

\begin{lstlisting}
K_el=RotMat.T.dot(K_el.dot(RotMat))
f_el=RotMat.T.dot(f_el)
G_el=RotMat.T.dot(G_el)
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Axisymmetric considerations}

We here rely on axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates, see Section~\ref{MMM-ss:axicyleqs}.
As shown on the following figure we assume that the deformation/flow is independent of the angle 
$\theta$ so that the remaining space coordinates are $r$ and $z$.
\begin{center}
\input{tikz/tikz_axi}
\end{center}

Given the symmetry of the problem any term containing $\partial_\theta$ or $\upnu_\theta$ is zero.
The strain rate tensor given in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:srcc} then simplifies to:

\begin{eqnarray}
\dot\varepsilon_{rr} 
&=& \frac{\partial \upnu_r}{\partial r} \nn\\
\dot\varepsilon_{\theta\theta}  &=& \frac{\upnu_r}{r} \nn\\
\dot\varepsilon_{\theta r} = \dot\varepsilon_{r\theta}  &=& 0 \nn\\
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} &=& \frac{\partial \upnu_z}{\partial z} \nn\\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{rz} = \dot{\varepsilon}_{zr} 
&=& \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial \upnu_r}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial \upnu_z}{\partial r} \right) \nn\\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{\theta z} = \dot{\varepsilon}_{z \theta} &=& 0 \nn
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the term $\dot\varepsilon_{\theta\theta} $ is not zero!
The deviatoric stress tensor ${\bm \tau}=2\eta \dot{\bm \varepsilon}$ can be computed
as well as the full stress tensor ${\bm \sigma}=-p {\bm 1} + {\bm \tau}$. 


In cylindrical coordinates, and in the axisymmetric case
the strain rate tensor is given by
\[
\dot{\bm\varepsilon}(\vec\upnu)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot\varepsilon_{rr} & 0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{rz} \\
0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{\theta\theta}  & 0 \\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{zr} & 0 & \dot\varepsilon_{zz}
\end{array}
\right)
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Computing normals - axisymmetric case only}

As seen in \stone~\ref{f151}, there are (at least) two ways to compute the normal at the
nodes on the surface: $\vec{n}_1$ which is purely geometric and $\vec{n}_2$ which is based 
on an integration of the basis function derivatives.
We found that in the case of the annulus the two coincided to machine precision. 
Let us now turn the half annulus. As an experiment, {\it all} nodes on the hull are flagged
and the normal $\vec{n}_2$ is computed. 
Since this normal is a function of basis functions and requires an integration 
over elements, we can ask ourselves whether the mapping and/or the number
of quadrature points influence the results of the normal calculations.
The {\tt script\_normals} bash script runs the required models - note that the
$Q_1$ mapping and nqperdim=2 have been removed from the loops.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/results/normals/nx}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/results/normals/ny}\\
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/results/normals/nnx}

{\captionfont components of the normal vector on the hull (first line),
on the surface (second line). Mesh is 8x96.}
\end{center}

We find that these normal vector components do not seem to depend on the mapping nor quadrature,
and that on the curved parts they match their geometrical counterparts $\vec{n}_1$.
These normal vectors are shown here:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/results/normals/normals}
\end{center}

Obviously, we need to look closer at the four nodes that belong to the surface and the cmb with $x=0$.
On the one hand they belong the vertical boundary $x=0$ so their horizontal velocity component should be zero (axisymmetry).
On the other hand they also belong to the curved boundaries. In the case of a near infinite resolution the 
normal to the curved part would align with the vertical axis so that we would then have $v=0$. 
In the end these 4 points should be prescribed no-slip boundary conditions.

In our case here only the surface can be prescribed free slip boundary conditions and there are {\python nnt} points at the surface.
Removing the 2 extremities, we have {\python nnt-2} Lagrange multipliers. Note that then how we compute normals is not relevant.

\section*{Pressure normalisation}

%-------------------------
\subsection*{Plane strain}

In polar coordinates the surface element is 
\[
dS = R d\theta
\]
so that 
$\int_0^{2\pi} dS = \int_0^{2\pi} R d\theta = 2 \pi R$ which is the perimeter of the circle.

We wish to normalise the pressure so that it is on average zero on the surface:
\[
p_{normalised} = p - <p>
\]
where 
\[
<p> 
= \frac{\int p(r, \theta) dS }{\int dS}
= \frac{\int p(\theta) R d\theta }{\int R d \theta d\theta}
= \frac{1}{2 \pi R} R \int p(\theta) d\theta 
= \frac{1}{2 \pi }  \int_0^{2\pi} p(\theta) d\theta 
\]
This integral is broken up in a summation over element edges which are at the surface.
\[
<p>= \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{e}^{nelt} \int_{\theta_{2}^e}^{\theta_{3}^e} p (\theta) d\theta
\]
where $\theta_2^e$ and $\theta_3^e$ are the $\theta$ values of nodes 2 and 3 of element $e$ that lie on the surface.
These edge integrals are simplifed by assuming a 1-point quadrature:
\[
<p>= \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{e}^{nelt}  p (\frac{\theta_2^e+\theta_3^e}{2}) (\theta_3^e-\theta_2^e)
\]




%------------------------------
\subsection*{Axisymmetric case}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3cm]{images/sphcoord}
\end{center}

In spherical coordinates, the surface element is 
\[
dS= R^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi
\]
We wish to normalise the pressure so that it is on average zero on the surface:
\[
p_{normalised} = p - <p>
\]
where 
\[
<p> 
= \frac{\iint p(\theta,\phi) dS }{\iint dS}
= \frac{\iint p(\theta,\phi) R^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi}{\iint R^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi}
\]
and since $p$ is independent of $\phi$ then 
\[
<p> 
= \frac{R_2^2 \cdot 2\pi \cdot  \int_0^\pi p(\theta)  \sin \theta d\theta}
{R_2^2 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int  \sin \theta d\theta }
= \frac{ 2\pi R_2^2 \int_0^\pi p(\theta)  \sin \theta d\theta} {4\pi R_2^2}
\]
The integral over $\theta$ can be simplified by using the average pressure 
along the edge and the angle of the edge middle point:
\begin{lstlisting}
poffset=0
for iel in range(0,nel):
    if surface_element[iel]:
       dtheta=theta_sph[iconV[2,iel]]-theta_sph[iconV[3,iel]]
       pmean=0.5*(p[iconP[2,iel]]+p[iconP[3,iel]])
       poffset+=np.sin((theta_sph[iconV[2,iel]]+theta_sph[iconV[3,iel]])/2)*dtheta\
                *2*np.pi*R2**2 * pmean
poffset/=4*np.pi*R2**2
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{From Cartesian to Spherical coordinates}

In order to compute the dynamic topography we will need $\sigma_{rr}$, 
which in fact will require $\dot{\varepsilon}_{rr}$. This means that 
having obtained the strain rate tensor in Cartesian coordinates we must 
rewrite it in spherical coordinates with the following conventions:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3cm]{images/sphcoord}
\end{center}

We have
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bm T}_{\tiny Sph}&=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{rr}       & T_{r\theta}      & T_{r\phi} \\
T_{\theta r} & T_{\theta\theta} & T_{\theta\phi} \\
T_{\phi r}   & T_{\phi \theta}  & T_{\phi\phi}
\end{array}
\right) \nn\\
&=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sin\theta \cos\phi & \sin\theta \sin\phi & \cos\theta \\
\cos\theta \cos\phi & \cos\theta \sin\phi & -\sin\theta \\
-\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{xx} & T_{xy} & T_{xz} \\
T_{yx} & T_{yy} & T_{yz} \\
T_{zx} & T_{zy} & T_{zz} 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sin\theta\cos\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\
\sin\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\sin\phi & \cos\phi \\
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0
\end{array}
\right) 
\nn\\
{\bm T}_{\tiny Cart} &=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{xx} & T_{xy} & T_{xz} \\
T_{yx} & T_{yy} & T_{yz} \\
T_{zx} & T_{zy} & T_{zz} 
\end{array}
\right) \nn\\
&=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sin\theta\cos\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\
\sin\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\sin\phi & \cos\phi \\
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{rr}       & T_{r\theta}      & T_{r\phi} \\
T_{\theta r} & T_{\theta\theta} & T_{\theta\phi} \\
T_{\phi r}   & T_{\phi \theta}  & T_{\phi\phi}
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sin\theta \cos\phi & \sin\theta \sin\phi & \cos\theta \\
\cos\theta \cos\phi & \cos\theta \sin\phi & -\sin\theta \\
-\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0 
\end{array}
\right) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
In our case, calculations take place in the 
$(x,z)$-plane so we have $\phi=0$ and the equation above 
becomes
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{rr}       & T_{r\theta}      & T_{r\phi} \\
T_{\theta r} & T_{\theta\theta} & T_{\theta\phi} \\
T_{\phi r}   & T_{\phi \theta}  & T_{\phi\phi}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sin\theta  & 0 & \cos\theta \\
\cos\theta  & 0 & -\sin\theta \\
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{xx} & T_{xy} & T_{xz} \\
T_{yx} & T_{yy} & T_{yz} \\
T_{zx} & T_{zy} & T_{zz} 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\]
We define $c_\theta=\cos\theta$, $s_\theta=\sin\theta$ so that
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{rr}       & T_{r\theta}      & T_{r\phi} \\
T_{\theta r} & T_{\theta\theta} & T_{\theta\phi} \\
T_{\phi r}   & T_{\phi \theta}  & T_{\phi\phi}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
s_\theta  & 0 & c_\theta \\
c_\theta  & 0 & -s_\theta \\
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_{xx} & T_{xy} & T_{xz} \\
T_{yx} & T_{yy} & T_{yz} \\
T_{zx} & T_{zy} & T_{zz} 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
s_\theta & c_\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
c_\theta & -s_\theta & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\]
As we have seen above we have 
\[
\dot{\bm\varepsilon}_{\tiny Cart}
=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} & 0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{xz} \\
0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{yy}  & 0 \\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{xz} & 0 & \dot\varepsilon_{zz}
\end{array}
\right)
\]
so 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\bm \varepsilon}_{\tiny Sph}=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot\varepsilon_{rr}       & \dot\varepsilon_{r\theta}      & \dot\varepsilon_{r\phi} \\
\dot\varepsilon_{\theta r} & \dot\varepsilon_{\theta\theta} & \dot\varepsilon_{\theta\phi} \\
\dot\varepsilon_{\phi r}   & \dot\varepsilon_{\phi \theta}  & \dot\varepsilon_{\phi\phi}
\end{array}
\right)
&=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
s_\theta  & 0 & c_\theta \\
c_\theta  & 0 & -s_\theta \\
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} & 0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{xz} \\
0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{yy}  & 0 \\
\dot{\varepsilon}_{xz} & 0 & \dot\varepsilon_{zz}
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
s_\theta & c_\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
c_\theta & -s_\theta & 0
\end{array}
\right)  \nonumber\\
&=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
s_\theta  & 0 & c_\theta \\
c_\theta  & 0 & -s_\theta \\
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} s_\theta + 
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} c_\theta  & 
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} c_\theta - 
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} s_\theta  &
0 \\
0 & 0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{yy}  
\\
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} s_\theta + 
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} c_\theta  &
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} c_\theta - 
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} s_\theta  &
0 
\end{array}
\right)  \nonumber\\
&=&
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} s_\theta^2 + 
2 \dot\varepsilon_{xz} c_\theta  s_\theta +
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} c_\theta ^2  
& 
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} c_\theta s_\theta - 
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} s_\theta^2  +
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} c_\theta^2 - 
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} s_\theta c_\theta 
& 0 \\ \\
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} s_\theta c_\theta+ 
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} c_\theta^2  -
\dot\varepsilon_{xz} s_\theta^2 -
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} c_\theta s_\theta 
&
\dot\varepsilon_{xx} c_\theta^2 - 
2\dot\varepsilon_{xz} s_\theta c_\theta +
\dot\varepsilon_{zz} s_\theta^2  
& 0 
\\ \\
0 & 0 & \dot{\varepsilon}_{yy} 
\end{array}
\right)  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We can easily verify that the trace of this tensor is zero.

In the code we need to be careful and use {\python theta\_sph}:

\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/images/theta}

\end{lstlisting}

\sigma_{rr}={\hat g}^T (2 \eta \varepsilon(\mathbf u)
- \frac 13 (\textrm{div}\;\mathbf u)I)\hat g - p_d
\] 
where 
$\hat g = \mathbf g/\|\mathbf g\|$ is the direction of 
the gravity vector $\mathbf g$ and $p_d=p-p_a$ is the dynamic 
pressure computed by subtracting the adiabatic pressure $p_a$ 
from the total pressure $p$ computed as part of the Stokes 
solve. From this, the dynamic 
topography is computed using the formula 
\[
h=\frac{\sigma_{rr}}{(\mathbf g \cdot \mathbf n)  \rho}
\] 
where $\rho$ is the density. For the bottom surface we chose the convection 
that positive values are up (out) and negative values are in (down), analogous to 
the deformation of the upper surface. 
The file format then consists of lines with Euclidean coordinates 
followed by the corresponding topography value.''

In this \stone the viscosity is constant in the domain, the flow 
is incompressible and $\vec{g}= -g_0 \vec{e}_r$ so we can compute the 
dynamic topography as follows:
\[
h = - \frac{-p + 2 \eta_0 \dot{\varepsilon}_{rr} }{\rho_0 g_0}
\]
This is of course valid if what is above the surface is a fluid with zero density.
This translates into:

\begin{lstlisting}
dyn_topo=np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)
for i in range(0,NV):
    if surfaceV[i] and xV[i]>=0:
       dyn_topo[i]= -(2*viscosity*e_rr[i]-q[i])/(rho0*g0) 
\end{lstlisting}

Note that in our case $\rho_0=1$ and $g_0=1$ so that in fact the dynamic topography 
is simply $-\sigma_{rr}$.

\section*{Notes to my frustrated self}

What I have tried to cure the pb of the weird anomalies at the poles.

\begin{itemize}
\item turning elements into real trapezes. Made things worse
\item different mappings. not much difference
\item when using blob, reduced densities. no difference
\item nb of quad points, no real difference
\item nb of elements in tangential direction, some difference but no cure
\item when using blob, drho/rho, no diff
\item type of b.c. at point corner below poles, no real diff
\item scaling of G matrix
\item different rotations/bc for free slip, no difference
\item using cmat matrix for dev strain rate, helped a little bit, no cure
\end{itemize}

Todo list

\begin{itemize}
\item visc profiles
\item rho profiles
\item time stepping
\item gravity calculations. import from f96, re-benchmark

\section*{Earth modelling}



We assume that viscosity is purely a function of depth\footnote{This is borrowed 
from stone 71}.. 

Five radial viscosity profiles are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first viscosity profile is a constant viscosity for all depths of $10^{22}$ Pa s.  
This value is an estimated value of what is normally found in the literature. 

\item The second viscosity profile comes from Yoshida et al (2001) \cite{yohk01}. It uses three different regions: lithosphere (0 km to 150 km), upper mantle (150 km to 670 km) and lower mantle (670 km to 2900 km). 

\item The third viscosity profile comes from Steinberger \& Holmes (2008) \cite{stho08} 
which is comparable to \cite{stca06}, but of the latter no available data was available. 
Data is read from the file \texttt{DATA/EARTH/eta\_stho08.ascii}. 

\item The fourth and fifth profile come from Ciskova et al (2012) \cite{civs12}. 
Data is read from the file \texttt{DATA/EARTH/eta\_civs.ascii}. 
The paper showcases two main families of radial viscosity profiles in literature. Family A, which has a sharp 
increase below the 660 km transition zone and remains constant for most of the lower mantle 
and family B which is much smoother over the transition zone and increases with depth in the lower mantle. 

\end{itemize}

\section*{Computing volumes}

Here we simply compute 
\[
{\cal V} = \sum_e \int_{\Omega_e} 2\pi x d\Omega
\]
where the sum runs over all elements of the domain.
We of course have 
\[
{\cal V}_{analytical} = \frac43 \pi (R_2^3-R_1^3)
\]
so that we can compute the relative errors as a function of resolution, mapping and quadrature: 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/vols/volumes.pdf}
\end{center}

\noindent Conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item unsurprisingly $Q_1$ mapping yields the worst results
\item mapping is the controling factor, much more than quadrature
\item for the isoparametric element (mapping $Q_2$) the number of quadrature points 
is not critical. Results are virtually identical for {\python nqperdim=2,3,4,5}
\item $Q_3$ about one order of magnitude more accurate than $Q_2$ 
\item $Q_4$ mapping 3-4 orders of magnitude more accurate than $Q_2$ mapping
\end{itemize}

\section*{Exp=0: Annulus convection benchmark (exp=0)}

In order to run this benchmark, the following two options must be False in the code:
\begin{lstlisting}
axisymmetric=False
surface_free_slip=False
\end{lstlisting}

This benchmark is documented in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:anconv}.

For reference, in this benchmark we solve the Stokes equation for an incompressible
isothermal fluid in an annulus of inner radius $R_1$
and outer radius $R_2$ with the following boundary conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inner boundary: $\upnu_r(R_1,\theta)=0$ 
\item Outer boundary: $\upnu_r(R_2,\theta)=0$ 
\end{itemize}
and the manufactured solution takes the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\upnu_\theta(r,\theta) &=& f(r) \cos(k\theta) \\
\upnu_r(r,\theta) &=& g(r) k  \sin(k\theta)  \\
p(r,\theta) &=& k h(r) \sin(k \theta) + \rho_0 g_r (r-R_2)  \\
\rho(r,\theta) &=& k \sin (k \theta) \aleph(r) + \rho_0 \\
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
A &=& \frac{2(\ln R_1 - \ln R_2)} { R_2^2 \ln R_1  - R_1^2 \ln R_2}    \nn\\
B &=& \frac{R_2^2-R_1^2}{R_2^2 \ln R_1 - R_1^2 \ln R_2} \nn\\
f(r)   &=& Ar +\frac{B}{r} \nn\\
f'(r)  &=& A - \frac{B}{r^2} \nn\\
g(r)   &=& \frac{A}{2}r  +  \frac{B}{r} \ln r - \frac{1}{r} \nn\\
g'(r)  &=& \frac{A}{2}  +  \frac{B}{r^2} (1-\ln r)   + \frac{1}{r^2} \nn\\
g''(r) &=&  - \frac{B}{r^3} (3 - 2 \ln r )  \nn\\
h(r)   &=& \frac{1}{r^2}(2g-f) \nn\\
\aleph(r) &=&  -g'' - \frac{g'}{r} ( 1 - \frac{2}{r}) + \frac{g}{r^2} (k^2 + 1 -\frac{4}{r})  
- \frac{2f}{r^2}  (1-\frac{1}{r}) - \frac{f'}{r^2}   \nn
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection*{Root mean square velocity}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/vrms}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/vrms_error}\\
{\captionfont Note that we define $h=(R_2-R_1)/nelr=1/nelr$.}
\end{center}

As expected linear mapping yields the worst results. However results are virtually identical for 
the three other mappings.
What is very surprising is the much higher accuracy of {\python nqperdim=2} (i.e. subparametric mapping) ?!


%---------------------------------------
\subsection*{Velocity and pressure errors}

We first look at the min/max values of the nodal velocity and pressure errors over all the nodes:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.4cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/u_err}
\includegraphics[width=5.4cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/v_err}
\includegraphics[width=5.4cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/p_err}\\
{\captionfont min/max of $u^h(x,y)-u^{th}(x,y)$ and $v^h(x,y)-v^{th}(x,y)$, min/max of $p^h(x,y)-p^{th}(x,y)$.} 
\end{center}
We see that all measurements decrease (in amplitude) when the resolution is increased and that 
the $Q_1$ mapping yields the largest errors. 
Interestingly the subparametric case {\python nqperdim=2} seems to yield more accurate 
pressure results.

Turning now to velocity and pressure errors in the $L_2$ norm, 
as expected with the \QtwoQone element (and already shown in \stone~\ref{f21})
we recover a cubic convergence for the velocity error and quadratic for the 
pressure... almost always.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/errv}
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_152/RESULTS/exp0/errp}
\end{center}

Our velocity and pressure error measurements are identical to those of \aspect.
But why does the subparametric mapping yield a pressure error that is superconvergent?

\subsection*{Strain rate errors}

Since the analytical velocity field is known so are the strain rate tensor components.
Similarly to \stone~21 this code computes the nodal strain rate components
in three different ways. 
\begin{itemize}
\item method \#1: strain rate components are computed in the middle of the element and then averaged over elements sharing a node.
\item method \#2: strain rate components are computed at each node of the element and then averaged over elements sharing a node.
\item method \#3: global recovery process as documented in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:gradrecovery}.
\end{itemize}

Errors are then computed in the same way as the velocity components.

Using {\tt script\_normals2} I look at velocity and strainrate at the surface
with both normals calculations. 
I have already confirmed/checked that the value of the normals at the poles is irrelevant
(no slip is prescribed there).

So on average (L2-norm) the velocity decreases in the domain (see plots at the 
beginning) but at the surface velocities increase?!

hwoever, since velocity solution is exactly 0 the contraints in the lagrange multipliers are also zero... pb?

The blob is prescribed as follows:

obtained with this \stone the overal velocity and strain rate are lower than the results obtained
with \aspect (5+2 mesh). What is also rather interesting is the fact that the \aspect velocity is
not zero at $r=R_2$. Also it would be interesting to run the \aspect model with a higher global resolution but 
that would take a lot of resources. These models were run on 192 MPI processes for a few minutes.}

$x,y$-plane the vtu file had to be rotated so as to align with the vtu file returned by \aspect.}

We now fix the resolution at 32x192 elements. This experiment is identical to experiment 2
except that we now vary the density of the blob. In experiment 2 it was 1\%. We explore other values:
5\%, 10\% and 50\%.

\section*{The blob test (exp=4)  with lithosphere - axisymmetric}

In this case we assign both the blob and the lithosphere ($r>1.875$ - the lithosphere
thickness is 1/8th the mantle depth) a viscosity $\eta=100$.

\section*{The blob test (exp=5)  with lithosphere, reduced rho - axisymmetric}

If we are using dynamic topo, it is because we impose free slip on surface(s).
If we do so, then there is a constant nullspace in the pressure, so we could 
work with reduced densities: $\rho_m=0$, $\rho_s=-0.01$.
After the solve the real full pressure can be recovered by adding to the 
computed one the lithostatic one.
At the surface, since the lithostatic pressure is zero, this will not change the 
dynamic topography values.

\end{center}

We find identical results as experiment 4, which tells us that the lithostatic pressure 
(or the background density $\rho_0$) does not influence the results (as expected).
This also means that the small instabilities observed near the poles are still present...

should i implement CBF too ?

try free surface?!
