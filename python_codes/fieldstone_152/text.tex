The code for this \stone is based on \stone~\ref{f21}. 

The goal here is to explore the influence of the mapping polynomial order and/or
the number of quadrature points on the accuracy of the solution of the so-called 
annulus benchmark \ref{MMM-xxxx}.

We will explore:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolution
\item nqperdim=2,3,4,5
\item mapping=Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4
\end{itemize}
and will monitor the computed area, and the velocity and pressure errors.

\end{center}

Conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item unsurprisingly Q1 mapping yields the worst results
\item the type of mapping is the controling factor
\item for the isoparametric mapping $Q_2$ the number of quadrature points 
is not critical. Results are virtually identical for nqperdim=2,3,4,5
\item Q3 about one order of magnitude more accurate than Q2 
\item Q4 mapping 3-4 orders of magnitude more accurate than Q2 mapping
\end{itemize}
