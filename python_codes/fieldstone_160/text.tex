There are three materials in the domain:
\begin{itemize}
\item crust: $\rho_{crust}=2300~\si{\kg\per\cubic\meter}$ and $\eta_{crust}=10^{23}~\si{\pascal\second}$;
\item mantle: $\rho_{mantle}=3300~\si{\kg\per\cubic\meter}$ and $\eta_{crust}=10^{21}~\si{\pascal\second}$;
\item weak zones: $\rho_{wz}=\rho_{crust}$ and $\eta_{wz}=10^{-3}\eta_{crust}$.
\end{itemize}
The domain is a Cartesian box of size $L_x=120~\si{\km}$, $L_y=100~\si{\km}$.
Free slip boundary conditions are imposed on all four sides. ${\bm Q}_2 \times Q_1$ elements are used.
The crust is 20~\si{\km} thick but is thickened (40~\si{\km} depth) in the middle 30~\si{\km}.
On each side we find weak zones as thick as the crust and 1~\si{\km} wide. 
The default resolution is set to 120$\times$1200 elements.
