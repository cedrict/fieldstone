\subsection*{Manufactured solution}

Before we start using the code for convection experiments, we wish to benchmark it
with a manufactured solution. 
We start from the velocity of the Donea \& Huerta benchmark in the unit square:
\begin{eqnarray}
u(x,y) &=& x^2(1- x)^2 (2y - 6y^2 + 4y^3)  \\
v(x,y) &=& -y^2 (1 - y)^2 (2x - 6x^2 + 4x^3) 
\end{eqnarray}
which we know to be divergence-free.
We postulate $p(x,y)=-x^3y^3+0.0625$ (so that it is on average zero over the domain) 
and set $\rho=1$, ${\bm K}={\bm 1}$, $\eta_f=1$ so that 
\begin{eqnarray} 
g_x(x,y) 
&=& -u(x,y) - \partial_x p \nn\\
&=& -u(x,y) +3x^2y^3 \nn\\ 
g_y(x,y)  
&=& -v(x,y) - \partial_y p \nn\\ 
&=& -v(x,y) +3x^3y^2 \nn
\end{eqnarray}
