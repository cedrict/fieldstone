\index{stopics}{$Q_1\times P_0$}

This stone carries out the benchmark of Section~\ref{MMM-ss:stokes_sphere2D}
with $Q_1\times P_0$ elements using the penalty formulation.
The domain is a unit square and the fluid is characterised 
by $\rho=1$ and $\eta=1$ 
while the sphere is characterised 
by $\rho=1.01$ and $\eta=1000$.
The gravity vector is $\vec{g}=(0,-1)$. 

Boundary conditions are free slip on all sides ({\tt bc\_type=0}), 
no slip on all sides ({\tt bc\_type=1}) or free slip on the sides and bottom and open 
on top ({\tt bc\_type=2}).
Viscosity and density directly computed at the quadrature points.
The results are presented in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:stokes_sphere2D} and compared to 
those obtained with other codes.

Also, because of the inherent symmetry we can solve the system 
on only half the domain:
