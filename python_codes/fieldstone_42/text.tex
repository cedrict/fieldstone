The idea behind this stone comes from the following excerpt of Fortin \& Fortin (1985) \cite{fofo85}:
\begin{center}

\end{center}

I then set out to reproduce this and to compare the results with continuous-pressure elements.
On the boundary of the domain $\Omega$ I impose $\vec\upnu=\vec{0}$ and 
the viscosity and density are set to 1. The gravity vector points downwards
with $|\vec{g}|=1$.
The analytical solution is $\vec\upnu(x,y)=\vec{0}$ and $p(x,y)=ay+b$, 
where the constants $a$ and $b$ are determined by the geometry and the buoyancy force.

Based on the figure above I set $L_x=16$ and $L_y=6$ and the angle is set to $45\degree$ (while it 
is about $15\degree$ on the figures below).
The chosen number of elements is $16\times 8$ as in \cite{fofo85}.
Rather arbitrarily the pressure is set to zero on the top right corner (This is not really
important since the pressure is defined up to a constant in this case).

I consider the following three different domain geometries:
\begin{center}

\end{center}
and three different elements: ${\bm Q}_1\times P_0$, ${\bm Q}_2\times Q_1$, and ${\bm Q}_3\times Q_2$.

\subsubsection*{geom=0}

I find that the checkerboard mode is present for the unstable ${\bm Q}_1\times P_0$
element. However, for all three elements the velocity is zero, down to machine precision.
For the two continuous-pressure elements the pressure at the top is 0 and 6 at the 
bottom as expected.

\subsubsection*{geom=1}

We find that the checkerboard mode is now absent and velocities are still zero
for all three elements. The pressure is hydrostatic and only depends on the $y$-coordinate.

\subsubsection*{geom=2}

As in Fortin \& Fortin (1985) we find that the velocity field now showcases 2 ``convection
cells'' for the  ${\bm Q}_1\times P_0$ element (although they have different shapes than 
the ones in their publication) while the velocity remains zero for the other two elements.

and ${\bm Q}_3\times Q_2$.}

On the following figure the root mean square velocity obtained with the 
${\bm Q}_1\times P_0$ element is shown as a function of 
the element size $h$. We find that it decreases quadratically with $h$.
