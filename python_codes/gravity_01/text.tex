Let us consider a vertical domain $Lx \times Ly$ where $L_x=1000km$
and $Ly=500km$. This domain is discretised by means of a grid which counts $nnp= nnx \times nny$ nodes.
This grid then counts $nel=nelx \times nely = (nnx-1)\times(nny-1)$ cells.
The horizontal spacing between nodes is $hx$ and the vertical spacing is $hy$.

Assume that this domain is filled with a rock type which 
mass density is given by $\rho_{medium}=3000kg/m^3$, 
and that there is a circular inclusion of another rock type  ($\rho_{sphere}=3200kg/m^3$) 
at location ($xsphere$, $ysphere$) of radius $rsphere$.
The density in the system is then given by 
\[
\rho(x,y) = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\rho_{sphere} \; {\rm  inside \; the\; circle} \\
\rho_{medium} \; {\rm outside \; the\; circle}
\end{array}
\right.
\]

Let us now assume that we place $nsurf$ gravimeters at the surface of the model. These are placed 
equidistantly between coordinates $x=0$ and coordinates $x=Lx$. We will use the arrays $xsurf$ and $ysurf$
to store the coordinates of these locations. 
The spacing between the gravimeters is $\delta_x=Lx/(nsurf-1)$.

At any given point $(x_i,y_i)$ in a 2D space, one can show that 
the gravity anomaly due to the presence of a 
circular inclusion can be computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
g(x_i,y_i)={2 \pi {\cal G} (\rho_{sphere}-\rho_0) R^2}\frac{y_i-y_{sphere}}{(x_i-x_{sphere})^2+(y_i-y_{sphere})^2}
\end{equation}
where $r_{sphere}$ is the radius of the inclusion, $(x_{sphere},y_{sphere})$ 
are the coordinates of the center of the inclusion, and
$\rho_0$ is a reference density.

However, the general formula to compute the gravity anomaly at a given point $(x_i,y_i)$ in space 
due to a density anomaly of any shape is given by:
\begin{equation}
g(x_i,y_i) = 2 {\cal G} \int\int_\Omega \frac{ \Delta \rho(x,y)  (y-y_i)}{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2  } dxdy
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the area of the domain on which the integration is to be carried out. 
Furthermore the density anomaly can be written : $\Delta \rho (x,y)= \rho(x,y)-\rho_0$.
We can then carry out the integration for each cell and sum their contributions:
\begin{equation}
g(x_i,y_i) = 2 {\cal G} \sum_{ic=1}^{nel} \int\int_{\Omega_e} \frac{ (\rho(x,y) -\rho_0)  (y-y_i)}{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2  } dxdy
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_e$ is now the area of a single cell.
Finally, one can assume the density to be constant within each cell so that $\rho(x,y)\rightarrow \rho(ic)$
and $\int\int_{\Omega_e} dx dy \rightarrow hx \times hy$ and then 
\begin{equation}
g(x_i,y_i) = 2 {\cal G} \sum_{ic=1}^{nel} \frac{ (\rho(ic) -\rho_0)  (y(ic)-y_i)}{(x(ic)-x_i)^2 + (y(ic)-y_i)^2  } s_xs_y
\end{equation}

We will then use the array $gsurf$ to store the value of the gravity anomaly 
measured at each gravimeter at the surface.

\paragraph{To go further}

\begin{itemize}
\item explore the effect of the size of the inclusion on the gravity profile.
\item explore the effect of the $\rho_0$ value.
\item explore the effect of the grid resolution.
\item measure the time that is required to compute the gravity. 
How does this time vary with nsurf ? how does it vary when the grid resolution is doubled ?
\item Assume now that $\rho_2<\rho_1$. What does the gravity profile look like ?
\item what happens when the gravimeters are no more at the surface of the Earth but in a satellite ?
\item if you feel brave, redo the whole exercise in 3D...
