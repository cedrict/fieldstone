\section{Introduction} \label{sec1}


The Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of most popular methods in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). 
When the method was first implemented 
in the early days of computers, memory limitations were severe and CFD practitioners logically 
focused on 'cheap' elements with a small memory footprint, such as the smallest velocity-pressure pair to 
solve the Stokes equations on quadrilateral: the bi/tri-linear velocity-constant pressure element, 
also denoted $Q_1 \times P_0$ (or sometimes $Q_1\times Q_0$, see \cite{grsa}). 

Unfortunately it was soon demonstrated that this element pair is not LBB-stable \cite{boni84,boni85} and this instability
manifests itself via the presence of the spurious checkerboard mode on regular meshes
which have been thoroughly analysed, see for example \cite{grsi94,chpc95,sagl81a,sagl81b}, 
despite a perfectly usable and reasonably accurate velocity field \cite{grsa,dohu03,bobf08,bobf13}.


In Gresho \& Sani \cite{grsa} it is labeled as follows: ``slightly unstable but highly usable''.
This lead some part of the community to use stable elements instead, such as the Taylor-Hood pair $Q_2\times Q_1$
(or its simplicial counterpart the $P_2\times P_1$ element \cite{thba25}), 
while the rest investigated various options to nevertheless use this element.
One can cite approaches which include a stabilizing matrix block in the lower right part of 
the otherwise empty part of the Stokes matrix\cite{kesi88,sike90,vibo92,nosi98},
the $Q_1^+\times P_0$ element of Fortin\cite{fort81}, or the $\tilde{Q}_1\times P_0$ element which adds 
a $Q_2$ bubble function to the $Q_1$ space \cite[p265]{brfo}.
Finally various stabilisations were also proposed for its 
$Q_1\times Q_1$ cousin \cite{dobo04,bodg06,busa13} but it was recently shown\cite{thba22} 
that this stabilised element is not suited to model buoyancy-driven flows, 
while retaining its usability in engineering applications.  

Arguments in favour of the $Q_1\times P_0$ element can be summarized as follows:
a) It insures mass balance at the element level \cite[p459]{grsa};
b) The pressure modes have been thoroughly analysed \cite{sagl81a,sagl81b,grsi94}.
One pressure mode is the hydrostatic mode, which is  
physical. The other one is the so-called checkerboard mode which is spurious;
c) When filtered out \cite{chpc95} the recovered pressure is usable;
d) Combined with a penalty formulation, the elimination of the pressure degrees of freedom 
yield a very compact SPD stiffness matrix \cite{zigo75,hulb79,zina82,redd82,odks82};
e) Like all other unstable elements, an irregular mesh yields a 
better numerical behaviour of the element \cite{qizh07} and pressure modes substantially subdue
(Brezzi \& Fortin p244: ``the known experimental fact that on a general
distorted mesh pressure modes disappear and the inf-sup constant is independent of h. 
This last fact is still resisting analysis.'')

Concerning the $Q_1 \times P_0$ pair, \cite{thba22} conclude:
``We believe that the $Q_1 \times P_0$ element is also not a viable
choice. As shown by several of the analytical benchmarks, the errors that result from using this element can
be orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding
errors that result from the Taylorâ€“Hood-type elements.
This is no longer the case once we consider discontinuous viscosity profiles [...], but this element
is also unable to accurately solve the buoyancy-driven
case discussed in Sect. 5.4.''

Another option, seldom explored, is the use of so-called macro-elements composed of $Q_1\times P_0$ elements. 
Two were shown to be stable in the mid 80s \cite{leta81,sten84}, followed by three more twenty years
later\cite{qizh07} but to the author's knowledge these macro-elements were never 
implemented and compared with each other, nor put through a series of benchmarks showcasing complex flow in the 
presence of large viscosity variations/contrasts. The present article aims at 
filling this gap and drawing conlusions as to their usability also in the case of buoyancy-driven flow
since the field of computational geodynamics has long relied on the $Q_1\times P_0$ element for the 
solution of the buoyancy-driven incompressible Stokes flow in the presence of 
dominating lithostatic pressure gradient due to the Earth's gravity field.

the Steinberg technique, not meshes like here.}

%\section{Macro-elements}\label{sec3}

Following Stenberg \cite{sten90}, we define by a macroelement $M$ ``a connected set of elements of which the 
intersection of any two is either empty, a vertex, or one edge or face in $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
and $\mathbb{R}^3$, respectively''.

In this work I focus on quadrilateral meshes and consider 8 
macro-elements, 5 from from the published literature (S, LT, QZ1, QZ2, QZ3) and 2 new ones (T1, T2) -- although 
the macro-element R fulfills the definition above it only consists of a $2\times 2$ patch of elements.
I will refer to macro-element R in what follows but the reader must simply understand a regular 
mesh of retangular elements in what follows.
These are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mes}.
Note that macro-element S is often cited in the literature as example of a stable macro-element, 
e.g. \cite{chba93}+books\cite{elsw}, but rarely the LT one which in fact predates it by three years. 
Also QZ3 was mentioned in 1995 by Idehlsohn et al \cite{idsn95} but not used in calculations. 

\begin{figure}[t]

\label{fig:mes}}
\end{figure}

Note that the new macro-elements proposed by the author have not been proven stable. They are arrived at 
observing the other existing ones and making sure that they contain at least one node that belongs to three 
elements so as to hamper checkboard modes.

%checkerboard: US
%chequerboard: UK

Looking  at Fig.~\ref{fig:mes}, we can also make the observation that some macro-elements 
have a two-fold symmetry (along the axis or the diagonals) while others have a four-fold one 
(axis and diagonals). May be more important is the fact that S, QZ3 and A are 'anisotropic', i.e., in 
the case of QZ3 for example, there is an edge joining two opposite corners but none joining the 
other two opposite corners.
In Table~\ref{tab1} I summarize the various properties which characterizes each macro-element.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Characteristics of all 8 macro-elements as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mes}.\label{tab1}}%
\end{table}

The stability of a velocity-pressure pair or a macro-element is often difficult to prove 
and various techniques have been proposed \cite{bobf13}. 
All 5 published macro-elements were shown to be LBB-stable and all showcase at least 
an internal node shared by an odd number of elements which makes a chequerboard pattern impossible. 
However, things are not that simple since macro-element T2 showcases 
4 such points and as we will see it is not stable and chequerboard patterns still occur 
albeit at the macro-element scale\footnote{I have used the macro-element technique of Stenberg 
also in Lamichhane to show that a patch of 2x2 m-e of T2 type have indeed a chequerboard mode}. 
Looking at a macro-element is therefore not sufficient to determine whether it is LBB-stable or not. 

Qi et al \cite{qizh07} state "[...] from the points of implementation and the approximation property, we 
would list five types of macro-elements from the best to worst as S, LT, QZ1, QZ2, QZ3." 
The authors unfortunately do not provide any numerical comparison between these 5 and their 
ranking is therefore not borne by hard evidence. Furthermore, we will find that our ranking disagrees with theirs. 
%Understand what their ranking is based on. My pragmatic approach - numerical testing!

\paragraph{A remark about the QZ1 and QZ3 macro-elements:}
Let us consider the triangular macro-element as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:triangle}.
As mentioned in \cite{rovira1992}, 
the velocity and pressure spaces in this case are isomorphic to those
of the $P_2^+ \times P_{-1}$ element \cite{thba25}. Since this velocity-pressure pair 
element satisfies the LBB condition, the macroelement depicted in this figure
composed of $Q_1 \times P_0$ elements is also be div-stable.

\end{figure}

\vspace{.4cm}


In the end, despite the existing literature, many questions remain with regards to these macro-elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Based on a handful of benchmarks is it possible to establish a ranking, or at the very least can we pinpoint the objectively worse one(s)?

\item Is there an optimal position for the additional internal nodes? (i.e. can we determine an optimal value of the 
$\epsilon$ parameter for each macro-element?)

\item Can these macro-elements be safely used for geodynamical 
buoyancy-driven flows in the presence of a strong hydrostatic pressure gradient?
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}


For the purpose of this paper, we are concerned with the numerical solution of 
the incompressible and isothermal Stokes equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
-\nabla \cdot \left[ 2\eta \varepsilon({\bm u}) \right] + \nabla p &=& \rho \bm g \qquad  \textrm{in $\Omega$},
\label{eq:conv_momentum}  \\  
-\nabla \cdot {\bm u} &=& 0    \qquad    \textrm{in $\Omega$},   \label{eq:conv_mass} 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\eta$ is the viscosity, $\rho$ the density, ${\bm g}$ the gravity vector, $\varepsilon(\cdot)$
denotes the symmetric gradient operator defined by $\varepsilon({\bm u})
=\frac 12 (\nabla {\bm u} + \nabla {\bm u}^{T})$, 
and $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^2$ is the domain
of interest. Both the viscosity $\eta$
and the density $\rho$ will, in general, be spatially variable.

In this paper the Stokes equations are discretised using the finite element method.
The unknowns are the velocity vector ${\bm u}$ and the pressure $p$ so that 
one speaks of a Mixed Finite Element method. 
A straightforward application of the Galerkin method yields the finite-dimensional 
variational problem: 
\textit{Find ${\bm u}_h\in {\cal Q}_1,p_h\in {\cal Q}_0$
so that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:discrete-formulation}
\left(\varepsilon(\bm v_h), 2\eta \varepsilon(\bm u_h)\right)  
- ( \nabla \cdot \bm v_h, p_h) &=&   ({\bm v}_h,\rho \bm g),\\
-(q_h,\nabla \cdot \bm u_h) &=& 0,
\end{eqnarray}
for all test functions ${\bm v}_h\in {\cal Q}_1, q_h\in {\cal Q}_0$.}
This procedure is rather standard and well documented in many 
textbooks \cite{grsa,dohu03,bobf13} and the reader is referred to these sources 
for more detail.

All (macro-)elements have been implemented in a dedicated Python code (see Supplementary material). 
An isoparametric mapping is used. 
The fully assembled Stokes matrix is passed to the default SciPy Python solver. 
Better solving strategies have of course 
been designed to solve the resulting saddle point \cite{begl05} but are not 
implemented since optimal performance is not of interest here.
The pressure nullspace due to the Dirichlet boundary conditions on all sides is removed 
after the linear system is solved, by imposing $\int_\Omega p dV= 0$.

The projection of the discontinuous pressure $p$ onto the velocity nodes is denoted by $q$. 
Techniques how to do so (and thereby filter out the checkerboard modes) have been presented 
for example in \cite{chpc95,legs79,thfb08}.
For simplicity, and since all elements have equal or very similar areas 
I have adopted the following simple procedure: each 
elemental pressure is added to the nodes making this element and later averaged:
\[
q_j = \frac{1}{nel_j} \sum_{e=1}^{nel_j} p_e
\]
where $nel_j$ is the number of elements to which node $j$ belongs.

When an analytical solution exists convergence rates are computed and 
we expect for smooth viscosity fields and/or boundary conditions that the convergence rates 
are optimal, i.e., that the errors satisfy the relationships
\begin{eqnarray}
\| {\bm u} - {\bm u}_h \|_{L_2} &=&  {\cal O}(h^{2}),     \\  
\| p - p_h \|_{L_2}   &=& {\cal O}(h^{1}),
  \label{eq:error-rates}
\end{eqnarray}
where $h$ is the average diameter over all cells in the mesh.
I will also measure and report on the convergence rate index for the nodal pressure $q$.

Looking at Fig.~\ref{fig:mes} we see that the elements inside the macro-elements 
have various sizes and shapes so 
the default version of each macro-element is the one for which all internal elements have the same area
(when possible -- see appendix), and I then define the average element size
$\langle h \rangle$ as the square root of the average elemental area.

In the case of non-isoviscous experiments the viscosity is computed at each 
quadrature point. The gradient and divergence blocks in the Stokes matrix are
scaled as explained in step 32 of the deal.II library\footnote{\url{https://www.dealii.org/9.0.0/doxygen/deal.II/step_32.html}}.

\section{The Donea \& Huerta manufactured solution as test case}

To test the implementation I first consider the manufactured solution 
proposed in Chapter 6 of \cite{dohu03} and also used in \cite{thba22,thba25}.
 
The domain is a unit square. The viscosity is set to $\eta=1$.
The velocity and pressure fields are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
u_x(x,y) &=& x^2(1- x)^2 (2y - 6y^2 + 4y^3)  \\
u_y(x,y) &=& -y^2 (1 - y)^2 (2x - 6x^2 + 4x^3) \\
p(x,y) &=& x(1 -x)- 1/6. 
\end{eqnarray}
The buoyancy force is obtained by inserting these expressions in Eq.~(\ref{eq:conv_momentum}).
Boundary conditions are no-slip on all sides of the domain.
The velocity and pressure fields are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dh1}a.

\caption{Donea and Huerta benchmark: velocity error,

\label{fig:resdh}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:resdh} the velocity and pressure errors are shown as a function of the 
average mesh size $h$ for all 8 macro-elements.

\begin{itemize}

%comment on velocity
\item We recover optimal rates for velocity ${\bm u}$ (quadratic convergence) for all macro-elements.
The 'R' macro-element is the most accurate, followed by S, LT, QZ1, QZ2, QZ3 which are very close, 
while the T1 and T2 macro-elements are the least accurate ones. 
%comment on vrms
\item All macro-elements converge to the correct root mean square velocity $u_{rms}$ and 
their accuracy follows the previously made observations on their respective velocity errors.

%comment on elemental pressure p
\item As expected the 'R' macro-element yields a pressure field showcasing a checkerboard so that 
the corresponding pressure error does not decrease with increasing $<h>$. 
\item The same observation can be made for macro-element 'T2'. 
\item All other macro-elements pressure errors converge linearly and the 'S' macro-element is
the most accurate of them all.
\item The amplitude of checkerboard modes is difficult to predict (it is a function 
of boundary conditions, mesh topology, even or odd numbers of elements per direction, flow features, ...) 

%comment on nodal pressure q
\item Because the 'R' and 'T2' macro-elements yield a checkerboard pressure field, we need not
assessing their nodal projection and these have then been removed from Fig.~\ref{fig:resdh}c.
\item A handfull of macro-elements (S, QZ2, QZ3) have their nodal pressure $q$ converge like ${\cal O}(h^{1.5})$
while the others (LT, QZ1, T1) ultimately see their nodal pressure converge linearly.
\item Again, 'S' is the most accurate of them all.

\end{itemize}


The newly-proposed macro-element T2 is not stable as the checkboard pattern is clearly visible 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:check}. 
Also, this macro-element also always yields the worse velocity error. It is therefore abandonned in what follows. 
As a conclusion, S is the clear best macro-element, followed by QZ2 and QZ3 macro-elements.

\section{Other isoviscous manufactured solutions}


%experiment=9
The second manufactured solution originates in Dohrmann \& Bochev \cite{dobo04} 
and the smooth exact solution is
\begin{eqnarray}
u_x(x,y) &=& x+x^2 - 2xy+x^3 - 3xy^2 + x^2y \\
u_y(x,y) &=& -y-2xy+y^2 -3x^2y + y^3 - xy^2 \\
p(x,y) &=& xy+x+y+x^3y^2 - 4/3
\end{eqnarray}
Here too the buoyancy terms can be obtained by inserting these expressions
in Eq.~(\ref{eq:conv_momentum}).
The analytical velocity is prescribed on all sides of the domain.
The velocity and pressure fields are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dh1}b,e.
Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:resexp9}.

\end{figure}

Conclusions
\begin{itemize}
\item velocity error converges quadratically for all macro-elements, except T2.
The most accurate is R, the least accurate QZ1.
\item elemental pressure error converges linearly for all macro-elements, except R and T2.
The most accurate is T1, the least accurate is QZ1.
\item the nodal pressure error converges as $h^{1.5}$ at low resolutions but ultimately 
the rate falls back to $h^1$. {\color{red} except QZ2?} 
\end{itemize}


%experiment=7
The third one can be found in Elman et al \cite{elsw}.
The gravity is vertical with $\vec{g}=-\vec{e}_y$, and 
density is given by $\rho(x,y)=8x-2$. The velocity and pressure fields are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
u_x(x,y) &=&  (2y-1)x(1-x) \\
u_y(x,y) &=& - (2x-1)y(1-y) \\
p(x,y) &=& 2x(1 - 2y)
\end{eqnarray}
The analytical velocity is prescribed on the edges of the domain. 
The velocity and pressure fields are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dh1}c,f.
and discretization errors are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:resexp7}.

\end{figure}

Conclusions
\begin{itemize}
\item velocity error converges quadratically for all macro-elements.

\item nodal pressure, S and QZ1 1.5, rest is 1

\section{Non-isoviscous manufactured solutions}



The following two manufactured solutions (SolKz and SolCx) are 
standard benchmarks in the computational geodynamics 
community  \cite{mozg96,mamo08,krhb12,gemd13,demh19,thba22}.
The analytical solutions are derived in \cite{zhon96} and available in open source codes
such as for example ASPECT\footnote{\url{https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect}} or 
Underworld2\footnote{\url{https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2}}.
The velocity and pressure fields for both solutions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sols}

\begin{figure}
\centering
a)\includegraphics[width=5cm]{../images/fields/vel_solkz}
b)\includegraphics[width=5cm]{../images/fields/vel_solcx}\\

d)\includegraphics[width=5cm]{../images/fields/press_solcx}
\caption{Velocity and pressure fields for the SolKz (a,c) and SolCx (b,d) 
experiments.} \label{fig:sols}
\end{figure}

For SolKz the viscosity is given by $\eta(y)=\exp(By)$ with $B=\ln 10^6 \simeq 13.8155$ 
and the density field by $\rho(x,y)=\sin(2y) \cos(3\pi x)$, with 
$\vec{g}=-\vec{e}_y$. 
Free slip boundary conditions are imposed on all sides of the domain.

\begin{figure}
\centering

\caption{SolKz benchmark: velocity error, 
root mean square velocity, elemental pressure error and nodal pressure error
as a function of the the average mesh size $h$.} 
\label{fig:ressolkz}
\end{figure}

Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ressolkz}.
Conclusions are nearly identical to those of the cavity benchmark:
all macro-element see their velocity error converge quadratically 
and their elemental pressure linearly, with R being the most accurate and
T2 the least accurate.
Looking at the nodal pressure we see that S and QZ2 errors converge as $h^{1.5}$
while all others start with $h^{1.5}$ but ultimately end up $h^1$. 
{\color{red} actually it looks like it is about 1.45??
RERUN with eta on q points!!!!}

The second benchmark SolCx uses a discontinuous viscosity profile with a large jump in
the viscosity value along the middle of the domain ($\eta=1$ on the left,
$\eta=10^6$ on the right), resulting in a discontinuous pressure field. 
The domain is also a unit square, boundary conditions are free-slip on all edges, and
the gravity vector points downwards with $|{\bm g}| = 1$. 
The density is given by $\rho(x,y) = \sin(\pi y) \cos(\pi x)$.

Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ressolcx}.
Nodal pressure error rates are ommitted as all 
measured rates are $h^{0.5}$ since the averaging 
involves using elemental pressures on each side of the viscosity divide,
precisely where the analytical pressure is discontinuous.
All macro-element velocity errors converge quadratically 
while the pressure errors converge linearly.
Surprisingly pressure modes do not occur and the R macro-element
is the most accurate for both velocity {\it and} pressure.

\section{Buoyancy-driven flow}



%paragraph for non geo ppl
What often characterizes geodynamical (mantle) modelling is the buoyancy-driven nature of the flow 
in the presence of a very strong hydrostatic pressure and a relatively small dynamic pressure.
On long periods of time the mantle and the lithosphere behave like non-Newtonian fluids
which effective viscosity ranges from about $10^{19}$ up to $10^{26}\si{\pascal\second}$, 
typical velocities are of the order of $1\si{\cm\per year}$, and pressure ranges from 
the atmospheric pressure at the surface ($\sim 10^5 \si{\pascal}$) up to about $100\si{\giga\pascal}$ 
at the core mantle boundary. The mantle is not well mixed and therefore not homeogenous: 
Subducted plate remnants which are colder than their surroundings are thought to slowly sink 
while thermo-chemical instabilities at the core mantle boundary are the location where 
so-called plumes root and traverse the mantle upwards.

The $Q_1\times P_0$ has been the workhorse of computational geodynamics for decades with 
very popular mantle convection and lithosphere deformation codes used in hundreds of publications
(see \cite{thba22} for a detailed list).
Note that it was also often employed with a pressure penalty formulation (\cite{kirh90,full95,brtf08}).

The following experiment is an idealised geodynamical setup \cite{thba22,thba25}.
and is similar or identical to the ones found in \cite{mamo08}, \cite{gery10}, \cite{thie11} 
and \cite{sctc20}.
The 2d domain is a square of size $L_x=L_y=512$km filled with a fluid (the ``mantle'')
of density $\rho_1=3200\si{\kg\per\cubic\metre}$ 
and viscosity $\eta_1=10^{21}\si{\pascal\second}$.
A square block of size $128\times 128\si{\km}$ is placed in the domain and
is centered at location ($x_c,y_c$)=($256\si{\km}$, $384\si{\km}$) so 
as to insure that its edges
align with cell boundaries at all resolutions (we thereby wish to avoid
cases where the quadrature points inside an element would have different
density or viscosity associated to them). It is filled with a fluid
of density $\rho_2=\rho_1+\delta \rho$ and viscosity $\eta_2=\eta^\star \eta_1$.
The gravity vector points downwards with $|{\bm g}|=10\si{\metre\per\square\second}$. 
Boundary conditions are free slip on all sides.

Density variations are often small compared to the density of the mantle itself
and they can be positive or negative: in a geodynamical context, 
the block could be interpreted as a detached slab
($\delta\rho>0$) or a plume head ($\delta\rho<0$). 
We here choose $\delta \rho=+8\si{\kg\per\cubic\metre}$, i.e. $\delta \rho/\rho_1 = 0.25\%$.
This quantity was varied extensively in previous publications but as we will see 
this will not be needed in this case. 

This experiment was run for resolutions $16m\times 16m$ with $m=\{1,2,4,8\}$ and $\eta^\star=1$. 
We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:block1} the velocity field obtained for all macro-elements on 
a $16\times 16$ macro-element mesh. 
We find that {\it only} the 'R' mesh yields a velocity field that is plausible, 
since all other 7 ones showcase very clear oscillations in and around the block.
We investigate further by analysing the vertical velocity $u_y$
on the line $x=L_x/2$ at different resolutions in Fig.~\ref{fig:block2}.
We find that with increasing resolution the oscillations decrease and 
all macro-elements converge to the expected velocity profile.
Finally, we also measure the pressure in the block 
at four locations corresponding to ($x_c \pm \delta x, y_c i\pm \delta y$),
where $\delta x = \delta y = 0.1$ m, and show the normalized pressures
at all four of these locations in Fig.~\ref{fig:block3}.

This is in line with the results obtained by \cite{thba22} and 
all these observations lead us to conclude that 
macro-elements composed of $Q_1 \times P_0$ elements cannot be used for buoyancy driven flows.

In an attempt to find a redeeming quality to the macro-elements 
we carry out an identical experiment albeit with so-called reduced densities:
the background lithostatic pressure is removed by substracting $\rho_1$
from all densities in the domain. In essence we are then solving for the dynamic
pressure alone. 
We find now that the velocity oscillations have disappeared 
so that all velocity fields visually resemble Fig.~\ref{fig:block1}a and 
there is no need present those. Instead we show the elemental pressure field in Fig.~\ref{fig:block4}.
Velocity profiles are also measured as in the full density case and 
all plots look identical to Fig.~\ref{fig:block2}a.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Conclusions about mms:\\
R nearly always better fr velocity but pressure modes amplitude unpredictable.
S often best stable m-e, followed by QZ2.

\item Conclusions about buoyancy-driven flows\\
use in geodynamics possible IF reduced density or rather high resolution (but then why not Q2xQ1). 
S is probably best overal.

\end{itemize}



Various remarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item
macro-e have two advantages: no checkerboard modes AND stable. 
So CG applied to Schur should converge in a number of iterations independent of h.
Should I explore this, plug in my citcom like solver (precond CG on Schur complement)
and look at which m-e requires the least iterations? 


\item 
Use of m-e in comp geodynamics: 
awkward with particle-in-cell , inner structure of macro-element could influence shear band angle. 
also, if used at high res, full density, what about mesh deformation?

\item can we extend all/some to 3D? stability proof ? I am not aware of any m-e in 3d !?
really, I just can't find a single paper with m-e similar to the ones above in 3d

\end{itemize}





%compute indicator (eigenvalue, ... ?) for meshes and rank them ? see chappelle bathe

%I need to understand how to prove LBB stability and apply it to 3D elts ?

%I disregard randomised regular meshes bc how much random is not clear.

\section{Question to Wolfgang}

The code solves the following manufactured solution problem
which originates in Dohrmann \& Bochev \cite{dobo04}: 
\begin{eqnarray}
u_x(x,y) &=& x+x^2 - 2xy+x^3 - 3xy^2 + x^2y \\
u_y(x,y) &=& -y-2xy+y^2 -3x^2y + y^3 - xy^2 \\
p(x,y) &=& xy+x+y+x^3y^2 - 4/3
\end{eqnarray}

The element pair I am using is $Q_1\times P_0$ (I know, but there is a good reason, I'll 
explain later, bear with me:).
The velocity and pressure fields are as follows:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/exp09/vel.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/exp09/press.png}
\end{center}

The analytical field is such that $\int_\Omega p dV= 0$.
As in our 2 previous papers, I solve the Stokes system (without 
any imposed constraint wrt zero pressure average) using a built-in direct solver
and later normalize the pressure to zero.

At this stage I must say that the same code running on the Donea \& Huerta manufactured
solution yields the right error rates for velocity and pressure, with a zest of pressure 
checker board modes.

If I run this new benchmark I find that the velocity is visually plagued by imperfections, 
that its error rate convergence is all over the place and that the pressure field 
is so 14 orders of magnitude off:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/exp09/velpb.png}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{../results/exp09/presspb.png}
\end{center}

If I now run it by incorporating the constraint $\int_\Omega p dV = \sum_e A_e p_e$ in the 
matrix itself I find that the problem described above is completely absent, fields are smooth, 
rates are what is expected, comparable to D\&H benchmark. 

I *suspect* that this behavior could be due to the fact that for once a manufactured solution 
does not rely on no-slip b.c. and may be there is some kind of imbalance in the overal (discrete)
flux (flow is incompressible, we should have $\int_\Gamma \vec{u}\cdot\vec{n}d\Gamma=0$) 
and therefore triggers insane pressure oscillations and 
yields the problem above? and my instinct then tells me that 
by adding this extra line (and corresponding column) of constraints in the matrix it somewhat 
introduces some 'wiggle room' (\#technicalterm:) that compensates for the error in the b.c. imposition?
 
Am I in the right direction? if so could you put some maths around this? 
If not, any idea what causes the pb, or the solution? :)
