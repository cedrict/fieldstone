The motivation for this \stone originates in \textcite{zibz98} (1998):

\begin{center}

\end{center}

In essence, we wish to write a function that generates a mesh like the 
one in the figure above.  

Note that what follows actually replicates Fig.~4e of the paper, which is
similar to the figure above but not identical (check lower left corner).
In order to build the mesh we need to label the nodes of the 'master' cell 
which is decomposed in 18 sub-elements:

We can now look at a mesh composed of $3\times 2$ of these cells.
We have then
\begin{eqnarray}
N_1&=&(nelx+1)*(nely+1) = 4*3 = 12 \text{ (corners of Q1 mesh)} \nn\\
N_2&=&nel*11  = 6*11=66         \text{ (inside nodes)}\nn\\
N_3&=&3*(nelx+1)*nely =3*4*2=24 \text{ (vertical sides nodes)}\nn\\
N_4&=&3*(nely+1)*nelx =3*3*3 = 27 \text{ (horizontal sides nodes)} \nn\\
N&=&N_1+N_2+N_3+N_4=129 \nn
\end{eqnarray}

The resulting mesh is then as follows:
