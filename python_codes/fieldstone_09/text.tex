The benchmark is described fully in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:anconv} in which 
an analytical solution to the isoviscous incompressible Stokes equations 
is derived in an annulus geometry. The velocity and pressure fields are as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
v_r(r,\theta)      &=&  g(r) k \sin(k\theta), \\
v_\theta(r,\theta) &=&  f(r) \cos(k \theta), \\ 
p(r,\theta)        &=&  k h(r) \sin(k \theta), \\
\rho (r,\theta)    &=& \aleph(r) k \sin (k \theta), 
\end{eqnarray}
with $f(r)$, $g(r)$, $h(r)$ given in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:anconv}.
The parameters $A$ and $B$ are chosen so that $v_r(R_1)=v_r(R_2)=0$, i.e.
the velocity is tangential to both inner and outer surfaces.
The gravity vector is radial and of unit length.
In the present case, we set $R_1=1$, $R_2=2$ and $C=-1$.
The parameter $k$ can take values 0,1,2,3,...
