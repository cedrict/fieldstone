The code uses a mixed formulation based on $Q_1 \times P_0$ elements.
Volume normalisation of the pressure insures $\int p dV = 0$. 
The benchmark is presented in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:square_streamfct}.
We quickly recall here the solution fields:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi(x,y)&=& \sin( m \pi x)\sin( n\pi y) \nn\\
u(x,y) &=& n \pi \sin (m\pi x)\cos(n\pi y)\nn\\
v(x,y) &=& -m\pi \cos(m\pi x)\sin (n\pi y)\nn\\
p(x,y) &=& \frac{m^2n+n^3}{m} \pi^2 \cos (\pi x)\cos(\pi y) \nn
\end{eqnarray}
where $m,n$ are integers. The domain is a square of size $2\times 2$.
Boundary conditions are free slip on all sides.

strain rate $\dot \varepsilon_{xy}$. 
From left to right: $(m,n)=(1,1)$, $(m,n)=(1,2)$, $(m,n)=(2,1)$, $(m,n)=(2,2)$.
Note that for $m=n$ we expect $\dot\varepsilon_{xy}=0$.}

We can now measure the dicretisation errors in the 2-norm and we recover the expected 
rates of quadratic convergence for the velocity error and linear convergence for the pressure.

Note that the assembly proces in the code is somewhat naive and therefore limits
the maximum resolution to about $128\times 128$ elements.
