Great seeing you in Vienna, and sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I attach a diagram that shows the overall geometry of the magma intrusion heat transfer problem weâ€™re interested in.

In terms of the values not shown on the model, here are a few numbers that might be useful:

    Channel depth: 10.5 km
    Channel thickness: 100 m
    Channel length: 110 km (perhaps up to 130 km, if possible)
    Intrusion temperature: 1250C
    Surface temperature: 0C (would be helpful if this could be a variable)
    Basal temperature: 1480C
    Model thickness: 25 km 

Does that cover everything you would need to know? I was planning to use an analytical solution for the channel velocity for different power-law exponents. Would this be something you need up front, or would I be able to code the velocity model? The main question is how fast the magma needs to flow to not cool during transport to not cool over the transportation of 110 km. So, we would want to vary the velocity magnitudes and pattern (i.e., power law viscous flow).

Thanks for offering to assist with this, and please let me know if you need anything else.
