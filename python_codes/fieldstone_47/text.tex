This stone showcases the MINI element (see Section~\ref{MMM-pair:mini})
which is used to solve the manufactured solution of Donea \& Huerta (see Section~\ref{MMM-mms1}).

The domain is a unit square and the grid is composed of triangles but for simplicity these 
are obtained by splitting rectangles in two, as shown hereunder:

Not shown are the nodes for the bubbles in the middle of each triangle.

As an experiment I have run convergence tests for two cases: using {\tt nqel=3},  
{\tt nqel=6} and {\tt nqel=7} quadrature points.
We find that the velocity and pressure errors convergence depends on this crucial parameter. 
For {\tt nqel=3} the velocity and pressure errors converge quadratically and linearly respectively
but for {\tt nqel=6,7} they converge as $h^2$ and $h^{1.5}$ respectively:

It is worth noticing that although the element is stable, and the error converges
at a respectable rate, the pressure solution is not 'clean': as shown on the 
following figure, there is still some under/overshoot with respect to the analytical solution.

\end{center}


Let us now explore the case where the nodes inside the domain are randomly perturbed, i.e. 
a random value  $(\delta_x,\delta_y)\in[-h_x/5,h_x/5]\times[-h_y/5,h_y/5]$ is added 
to their position (while preserving the position of the bubble as the barycenter of each triangle), 
as shown hereunder:

\end{center}
 
Looking again at the convergence rates of the errors, we see that the velocity errors 
are virtually unchanged but we observe that the pressure errors rate is somewhere between 
${\cal O}(h^{1.5})$ and ${\cal O}(h^{1})$.
