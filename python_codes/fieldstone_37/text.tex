The domain is a unit square. The Stokes equations are not solved, the velocity is prescribed 
everywhere in the domain as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
u(x,y)&=&-(y-0.5)\nn\\
v(x,y)&=&(x-0.5) \nn
\end{eqnarray}

If {\tt RKorder} is zero, then velocity is computed on the particle itself via the equation above. 
If {\tt RKorder} is 1,2,3,4,5 then the corresponding Runge-Kutta algorithm (in space) is used and basis functions are
used to interpolate the velocity from the nodes onto the particles.. 
Particles can be placed on a regular grid or randomly inside each element at the beginning.
The timestep is controlled via a CFL condition.    
When particles are advected outside the domain, they are arbitrarily placed at location (-0.0123,-0.0123).

I will some day add a population control algorithm to replenish elements with not enough particles.
