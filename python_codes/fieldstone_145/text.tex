This \stone is a simple example of how one can easily read in (p)vtu files, extract the raw data for the fields and 
then for example post-process them, or plot them in a different way.
I cannot predict your exact requirements when it comes to colorscale, aspect ratio, legends, types of data, etc ...
so you will need to figure a few things out on your own. 

In this example there are 4 {\tt .pvtu} files coming from an article in prep. 
These are read in, and converted to png in a crude way. 
This is what the code displays when running
\begin{verbatim}
found  4  pvtu files
processing  solution-00000.pvtu which contains  22905  data points
-----> strain rate m/M: 8.305214e-12 1.1551771e-11
-----> viscosity m/M: 1.8379192e+18 3.4957697e+18
processing  solution-00002.pvtu which contains  22905  data points
-----> strain rate m/M: 5.3416676e-12 1.4275901e-11
-----> viscosity m/M: 1.4940624e+18 6.7333757e+18
processing  solution-00001.pvtu which contains  22905  data points
-----> strain rate m/M: 7.17326e-12 1.27030435e-11

-----> viscosity m/M: 1.3733053e+18 2.1652515e+19
\end{verbatim} 
and here are the files produced
