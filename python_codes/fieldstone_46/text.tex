This \stone showcases the Crouzeix-Raviart element (see Section~\ref{MMM-sec:crouzeix-raviart})
used to solve the analytical problem "Donea \& Huerta" (see Section~\ref{MMM-mms1}).

Note that the assembled matrices $\K$ and $\G$ are first built and then assembled
into the Stokes matrix, all not in sparse format. As such the code is not very efficient 
and memory requirements increase quickly.
