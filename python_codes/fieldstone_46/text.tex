This stone showcases the Crouzeix-Raviart element (see Section~\ref{MMM-sec:crouzeix-raviart})
used to solve the analytical problem "Donea \& Huerta" (see Section~\ref{MMM-mms1}).

Out of convenience the pressure is set to zero at location $(x,y)=(1,1)$, so that the 
analytical solution is now $p(x,y)=x(1-x)$.

I seem to just not quite obtain a quadratic convergence for pressure. Could it come 
from the p b c ?
