\section*{Theory and equations}

As an introduction to the topic of how the FEM can be
performed on systems of equations, we consider the following equations
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} &=& \Delta A  + \gamma (a-A+A^2B) \\
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} &=& d \Delta B  + \gamma (b-A^2B) 
\end{eqnarray}
with the two unknowns, $A$ and $B$. This system of equations is used to model the interaction between
two interacting chemicals $A$ and $B$ \cite{mawb12}.

$B$ represents the concentration of a ``substrate'' (inhibitor) chemical 
that is consumed in a reaction by some chemical ``activator'',
with concentration $A$. The reaction produces the activator, which explains 
the $A^2B$ terms in both equations. Both substances are also produced 
at some background rate ($\gamma a$ for $A$ and $\gamma b$ for $B$,
respectively) and $A$ decays with first-order kinetics at a rate $\gamma$.

This ``substrate depletion'' reaction
model is known as Schnakenberg kinetics \cite{gime72,schn79}. This
model is most widely applied in biology, but it might also be relevant 
in Earth science to explain
the formation of self-organizing patterns, for example, 
related to mineral growth, stromatolites and
corals, concretions, and so on.

The setup of the experiment as well as the boundary conditions
is shown in the following figure:

\begin{center}

\end{center}

The domain is a square of size 5. At $t=0$ the fields are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
A(x,y)&=&a+b+r \nn\\
B(x,y)&=& \frac{b}{(a+b)^2} +r
\end{eqnarray}
which is the steady-state solution with a small random 
perturbation $r$ (that has a maximum amplitude
of 1/100). No flux (zero gradient) conditions are considered across 
all lateral boundaries.

In the book we find:
{\small 
\begin{verbatim}
lx = 5 ; % length of x domain
ly = 5 ; % length of y domain
d = 20 ; % diffusivity of species B
a = 0.05 ; % growth rate of species A
b = 1 ; % growth rate of species B
gamma = 600 ; % kinetics
amp = 0.01 ; % max. amplitude of random noise
ntime = 200 ; % total number of time steps to compute
nxe = 50 ; % number of elements in x-direction
nye = 50 ; % number of elements in y-direction
dt = 5e-4 ; % time step
\end{verbatim}
}

The coupled PDEs are nonlinear: they both contain the term $A^2B$. As such 
a specific algorithm must be employed so as to make sure that the 
equations are adequately solved. Picard iterations are then used.
Since the matrix does not change (only the rhs) we will be making use of this fact.

\begin{eqnarray}
\int \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} dV \cdot \frac{\partial \vec{\cal A}}{\partial t} + 
\int {\bm B}^T \cdot {\bm B} dV \cdot \vec{\cal A} 
&=& \int \vec{\bN}^T \gamma a dV 
- \gamma\int \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} dV \cdot \vec{\cal A}
+ \int \vec{\bN}^T \gamma A^2 B dV \nn\\ 
\int \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} dV \cdot \frac{\partial \vec{\cal B}}{\partial t} + 
\int d {\bm B}^T \cdot {\bm B} dV \cdot \vec{\cal B} 
&=& \int \vec{\bN}^T \gamma b dV 
- \int \vec{\bN}^T \gamma A^2 B dV 
\end{eqnarray}

We define the mass matrix $\M$ and the diffusion matrix $\K_D$ as follows:
\[
{\M} = 
\int \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} \; dV 
\qquad
\K_D = 
\int {\bm B}^T \cdot {\bm B} \; dV  
\]
so that we have (note that  the $a$, $b$, $d$ and $\gamma$ coefficients are
constant in space so we can take them out of the integrals)
\begin{eqnarray}
{\M} \cdot  \frac{\partial \vec{\cal A}}{\partial t} + 
\K_D \cdot \vec{\cal A} 
&=& \int \vec{\bN}^T \gamma a dV 
- \gamma \int \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} dV \cdot \vec{\cal A}
+ \int \vec{\bN}^T A^2 B dV  \nn\\
{\M} \cdot  \frac{\partial \vec{\cal B}}{\partial t} + 
d\; \K_D \cdot \vec{\cal B} 
&=& \int \vec{\bN}^T \gamma b dV 
- \gamma \int \vec{\bN}^T A^2 B dV 
\end{eqnarray}
We approximate the time derivative by a simple forward step:
\[
\frac{\partial \vec{\cal A}}{\partial t}  \simeq
\frac{ \vec{\cal A}^n - \vec{\cal A}^{n-1}  }{\delta t} 
\]
so that we have
\begin{eqnarray}
{\M} \cdot \frac{ \vec{\cal A}^n - \vec{\cal A}^{n-1}  }{\delta t}  +
\K_D \cdot \vec{\cal A}^n 
&=& \gamma a\int \vec{\bN}^T \;  dV 
- \gamma \underbrace{\int \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} \; dV}_{\M} \cdot \vec{\cal A}^n
+ \gamma \int \vec{\bN}^T (A^n)^2 B^n \; dV  \nn\\
{\M} \cdot \frac{ \vec{\cal B}^n - \vec{\cal B}^{n-1}  }{\delta t}  +
d \K_D \cdot \vec{\cal B}^n 
&=& \gamma b\int \vec{\bN}^T \; dV 
- \gamma \int \vec{\bN}^T (A^n)^2 B^n \; dV 
\end{eqnarray}
or, after multiplying both equations by $\delta t$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\underbrace{
((1+\gamma \delta t) {\M} + \K_D  \delta t )}_{\K_A} \cdot \vec{\cal A}^n 
&=& 
\underbrace{\delta t \gamma a \int \vec{\bN}^T  dV 
+ \delta t\int \vec{\bN}^T (A^n)^2 B^n dV  
+ {\M} \cdot \vec{\cal A}^{n-1}}_{\vec{f}_A}
\nn\\
\underbrace{(\M + d \K_D \delta t)}_{\K_B} \cdot \vec{\cal B}^n 
&=& 
\underbrace{
\delta t \gamma b \int \vec{\bN}^T dV 
- \delta t\int \vec{\bN}^T (A^n)^2 B^n dV 
+ {\M} \cdot \vec{\cal B}^{n-1}}_{\vec{f}_B}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the rhs vectors depend on $A^n$, $B^n$ and their value at the previous time step.
These are given by 
\[
A^n = \vec{\cal N}\cdot \vec{\cal A}^n
\qquad 
B^n = \vec{\cal N}\cdot \vec{\cal B}^n
\]
When building the rhs we assume $\vec{\cal A}^{n-1}$ and $\vec{\cal B}^{n-1}$ known in the calculations.

\section*{Simple approach} The FE matrix structure is as follows:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\K_A & 0 \\
0 & \K_B
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{\cal A}\\
\vec{\cal B}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{f}_A\\
\vec{f}_B
\end{array}
\right)
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Different approach} 
The rhs of the first equation contains the term $\gamma A^2B$
so that we have to compute
\[
\gamma \int \vec{\cal N}^T A^2 B dV
\]
In the previous approach we take $A$ and $B$ as obtained from the previous nonlinear iteration. 
However, we could do things a little bit differently by only taking $A$ from the previous iteration (so $A_{k-1}$)
while keeping $B_{k}$.

\[
\M_A \cdot \vec{\cal B}^n_k =  \int A_{k-1}^2 \vec{\bN}^T \vec{\bN} dV  \cdot \vec{B}_k^n
\]


The FE matrix structure is then as follows:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\K_A & \M_A \\
0 & \K_B
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{\cal A}_k\\
\vec{\cal B}_k
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{f}_A\\
\vec{f}_B
\end{array}
\right)
\]

\section*{Results} 

This is a rough take.
I need nonlinear iterations to take care of the nonlinearities introduced by the rhs
I need to explore whether part of the rhs could not make its way in the matrix. 
Quid of the nl convergence ?
This is 1st order implicit in time. Crank-Nicolson ?
Check analytical solution
