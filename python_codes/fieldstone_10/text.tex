\subsection*{Manufactured solution ({\tt experiment=5})}

It is described in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:mms3Dgen}.
The velocity and pressure fields are:
\begin{eqnarray}
u(x,y,z) &=& x(1-x)(1-2y)(1-2z)\\
v(x,y,z) &=& (1-2x) y(1-y) (1-2z) \\
w(x,y,z) &=& -2(1-2x)(1-2y)z(1-z) \\
p(x,y,z) &=& (2x-1)(2y-1)(2z-1)
\end{eqnarray}
This flow field has the built-in property that there is no flux through the 
boundaries, i.e. the normal component of the velocity field is zero on each face.

\end{center}
We recover the expected second order velocity error convergence 
and first order pressure error convergence. 
Surprisingly, we find that the results are not sensitive to the value of the penalty parameter $\lambda$.

This \stone is implemented in both python and julia, in order to look at
performance aspects. Both versions of the code are as close to each other 
as possible. The FE build and solve times are recorded and we find
that the build time grows linearly with the number of elements in the python 
case but not in the julia case. I suspected that the sparse storage of julia
(as opposed to a linked list converted to sparse matrix in python) makes it slow
so I ran the code without the assembly and indeed it is then linear with the 
number of elements.
I need to find a better way!!

\subsection*{Stokes sphere}

The domain is a unit cube. Free slip boundary conditions 
are imposed on all sides. The mesh counts 
nelx*nely*nelz=nel elements and 
nnx*nny*nnz=NV nodes.
The density and the viscosity are prescribed in the domain 
by means of two functions:
the density is set to $1+\delta \rho$ inside a sphere of radius 0.123456789 centered 
at (0.5,0.5,0.5) and 1 outside. The viscosity is 1000 inside the sphere
and 1 outside.  The gravity vector is set to $\vec{g}=(0,0,-1)$.
This is the benchmark presented in Section~\ref{MMM-ss:stokes_sphere_3D}.

The FE matrix size grows even faster now than in the previous 2D case so
choosing the right matrix storage is of paramount importance. 

Three experiments are carried out:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Exp.~1:] the one described above.
Free slip or no slip boundary conditions.
We see that the pressure field is dominated by the lithostatic signal.
\item[Exp.~2:] same as experiment 1, but a reference density of 1 is substracted to all densities, so that 
the sphere density is 1 and the density of the surrounding fluid is now 0. In essence, we remove a
'background' density which does not participate in the flow generation, and thereby get rid of the 
lithostatic signal of the pressure.
Free slip or no slip boundary conditions.
\item[Exp.~3:] same as experiment 2, but the top boundary is now open (free surface)
\end{enumerate}

Note that a similar fortran code is present in the folder. 

If the option 'quarter' is true, then the model takes advantage of the symmetries 
of the problem and runs it in a quarter of the original domain, so that 
the domain is then $0.5\times 0.5 \times 1$. Measurements/results are identical 
to the full cube ones, but at a much lower cost.
