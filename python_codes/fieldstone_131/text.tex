In previous stones we have used the {\tt triangle} code \url{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html}.
Although very fast and very stable, this code is written in C and the interface with python 
is therefore not optimal. Typically one would generate the nodes on the convex hull and inner 
material boundaries, write these into a file, have {\tt triangle} read these in, return the 
generated mesh into a file, and read the latter in the FEM python code. 

However, there is a python module which is capable of generating Delaunay triangulations like {\tt triangle}
and we here explore its use. In order to install it:
\begin{verbatim}
pip3 install triangle
\end{verbatim}

In the {\python stone.py} you will find five examples illustrating the various 
uses of this library. The code also provides an export to vtu file.

\section*{From linear triangles to quadratic ones}

In the case quadratic triangular elements are to be used a conversion $P_1 \rightarrow P_2$
is provided.

Two methods are implemented. The first one is naive and therefore not efficient at all:
It essentially creates all mid-edges points for all triangles and then looks for those 
that are situated at the same coordinates and remove doubles. 
The second one generates the mid-edge nodes progressively and checks that they do not 
exist yet (by means of a connectivity matrix which registers edges - 
stored as vertices pairs).


The file {\pythonfile stone2.py} contains multiple functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\pythonfile export\_elements\_to\_vtuP1}
\item {\pythonfile export\_elements\_to\_vtuP2}
\item {\pythonfile mesh\_P1\_to\_P2\_naive}
\item {\pythonfile mesh\_P1\_to\_P2}
\end{itemize}

{\captionfont $P_1$ mesh (left), $P_2$ mesh (right)}
\end{center}

In the case of a full disc, we vary the number of triangles and find that 
the second algorithm strongly outperforms the first one:
