This is an attempt at replicating \fullcite{kiso20} with both a self-made Python code and the 
community code ASPECT.
When replicating a study I will always reproduce the abstract:
\begin{displayquote}
{\color{darkgray}
Edge-driven convection, which affects partial melting, intraplate volcanism, and dynamic topography, is small-
scale convection that occurs along a lithospheric keel with a sharp contrast in lithospheric thickness. Various
factors, including Rayleigh number, lateral mantle temperature heterogeneity, and geometry of the keel, 
influence the edge-driven convection, and the correlation between edge-driven convection and surface expressions
(dynamic topography and volcanism) is complicated. We performed a finite element study to quantify the effects
of these factors on dynamic topography and partial melting. We found that the dynamic topography is more
prominent when a strong edge-driven convection cell develops, which corresponds to homogeneous mantle
temperatures and the absence of mantle wind. In contrast, the development of edge-driven convection cells and
dynamic topography near the lithospheric keel are hindered when the mantle temperature is strongly 
heterogeneous (laterally varying $\sim$280 K). This indicates that a large lateral contrast 
in mantle temperature results in a
strong mantle wind that may prevent the development of edge-driven convection cells. An increase in the
Rayleigh number results in more vigorous convection and enhances partial melting. Our study shows that the
location of volcanic activity at craton edges and passive margins can be reproduced in models with weakly
heterogeneous mantle temperature for given mantle viscosity. The existence of a strong mantle wind (e.g.,
related to subducting slabs or mantle plumes) may inhibit the formation of an edge-driven convection cell and its
related partial melt near a lithospheric keel. However, mantle conditions with weak temperature heterogeneity
($< \sim 14$ K) or high mantle viscosity ($> 17\times 10^{19}~\si{\pascal\second}$), which corresponds 
to the Rayleigh number of $1.8\times 10^6$,
do not induce partial melts despite the development of edge-driven convection cells. Our model parametrized the
condition and location of edge-driven convection cells and partial melts, which can contribute to understanding
anomalous intraplate volcanisms, such as in Jeju Island south of the Korean Peninsula and the Tanzania Craton
near the East African Rift.}

\section*{The setup}

I then proceed to thoroughly read the paper in order to extract all what is needed to setup 
the experiment. 
The authors present the following equations after explaining that all quantities in these
are dimensionless:
\begin{center}
\boxed{\includegraphics[width=9cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_168/images/kiso20c.jpg}}
\end{center}
with the following table of parameters:
\begin{center}
\boxed{\includegraphics[width=9cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_168/images/kiso20a.jpg}}
\end{center}
We also find a setup figure that shows the geometry, 
boundary conditions, initial temperature, etc ...
\begin{center}
\boxed{\includegraphics[width=12cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_168/images/kiso20b.jpg}}
\end{center}

In the text we further find: $L_x=1200~\si{\km}$ and $L_y=600~\si{\km}$.
The lithospheric thickness decreases from
0.333 (200~\si{\km}) to 0.083 (50~\si{\km}) through the necking zone with a finite
width (i.e., NZ).
Most of the numerical models in the paper use a lithospheric
geometry with NZ=30~\si{km}. However, other lithospheric geometries 
with NZ=1200~\si{\km} and 300~\si{\km} were tested to
explore the effect of NZ on EDC (edge-driven convection) cell generation.

The viscosity of the lithosphere is $10^5$ times that of the asthenosphere.
All viscosities are linear and temperature independent (although 
later on in the paper the authors explore temperature-dependent viscosities).
The authors use $\Ranb$ values from $10^5$ to
$10^7$ by controlling mantle viscosity from $300\cdot 10^{19}~\si{\pascal\second}$ to
$3\cdot 10^{19}~\si{\pascal\second}$, respectively. Radiogenic and 
adiabatic heating within the crust are ignored.

The thermal boundary conditions of the model are $T_t=273~\si{\kelvin}$
and $T_b=1673~\si{\kelvin}$ for the top and bottom temperatures
and from the figure we see that no heat-flux boundary conditions are
prescribed on the sides.
The initial temperature was set to $1673~\si{\kelvin}$ along and below the LAB
(thick black line on the figure above).
In order to explore the effect of long-wavelength thermal heterogeneity 
on EDC the authors add a background temperature heterogeneity 
so that the temperature in the asthenosphere is given by:
\[
T(x,y)=T_b + T_H \sin\left(\frac{\pi y}{L_y}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{2 L_y} \right)
\]
where $T_H\in \{0.1,0.01,0.001 \}\cdot 1400~\si{\kelvin}$ 
refers to the magnitude of temperature heterogeneity.

The temperature field inside the lithosphere is shown in the right 
insert of the figure above but its exact expression is not specified,
nor how it is prescribed inside the necking zone.
All we know is that ``A thicker lithosphere has a
more gradual geothermal gradient than a thinner lithosphere''.

Based on the equations, and in the absence of a $Rb$ number in the 
rhs (e.g. \cite{chsg14}) that accounts for the different buoyancy of the 
materials in the domain, we will assume that both lithosphere and 
asthenosphere have the same density $\rho_0$ and thermal expansion 
coefficient $\alpha$. From the equations above we can infer that the 
authors use the Boussinesq approximation, with $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\alpha T)$ 
in the rhs of the momentum equation.

When it comes to the boundary conditions for the Stokes equations, 
we read ``We did not impose any kinematic boundary condition for driving 
mantle convection'', which (also based on the figures) probably means 
that free slip boundary conditions are imposed on all sides.

The authors solve the equations with the commercial code COMSOL.
The finite element method is used with $Q_2\times Q_1$ elements for velocity and
pressure respectively and $Q_2$ elements are used for temperature.
They use a resolution of 5~\si{\km}, so that there are $240\times 120$ 
elements in the domain\footnote{We read in the paper: ``The domain for 
numerical simulation was divided by $241\times 121$ grids in the 
horizontal and vertical directions, respectively''.
This obviously makes little sense. Also the mesh would then consist of 
$481\times 241$ velocity nodes, not $241\times 121$.}.

\vspace{1cm}

On the back of the observations above I contacted Prof. So, and 
asked him the following questions. His answers (to the best of his ability, since
the study was already 5 years old upon my contacting him, the original COMSOL
input file was lost and he was not 
the first author) came fast and were nicely detailed. They are reproduced below in {\color{darkgray} dark gray}:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Do both lithosphere and asthenosphere have the same density?\\
 {\color{darkgray} yes}

\item What is the exact shape of the LAB. How is it parameterised?  \\
{\color{darkgray} 
Lab was very simply parameterized. I think that it follows the tanh function\footnote{
\url{https://www.comsol.com/support/learning-center/article/Modeling-Step-Transitions-50151}}.}

\item How is the initial temperature inside the lithosphere prescribed? \\
{\color{darkgray} I remember that we made an initial temperature profile using steady-state heat conduction. 
(top temperature: 0, LAB temperature: 1, and bottom temperature: 1).}\\
This assertion is refuted by the right insert of Fig.~1 of the paper where 
temperature profiles seem to indicate a half cooling space of some sort.
This does not matter that much since the lithosphere does not deform.

\item Is the perturbation with the $T_H$ term applied {\it everywhere} in 
the asthenosphere? \\
{\color{darkgray} Yes. All over the mantle. I think the brown line above 
has confused you. I am sorry.}
 
\item The temperature perturbation is not zero on the LAB, which renders the 
initial temperature field discontinuous there. Is this not a problem? \\
{\color{darkgray}
It is important. I didn't recognize it. But the reference model was similar 
to King and Anderson (1998). So, I thought it was not a problem.}


\item What is not clear from the setup in the paper is whether or not the lithosphere 
deforms with time. We know that time stepping is carried out (temperature is advected,
the $v_{rms}$ evolves with time), but if the lithosphere also deforms with the flow, 
what is the technique employed? particle-in-cell? compositional fields? \\
{\color{darkgray}
True. It is a very simple model like King and Anderson (1998). I think that the viscosity of the lithosphere 
has no meaning, only with much higher viscosity with viscosity. Also, there is no temperature dependence 
on viscosity. So the velocity field of the lithosphere is almost zero compared to the mantle.
Above the LAB, the viscosity is simply fixed to large viscosity. Then the velocity is very small. 
The only advection quantity is temperature in our simple modeling. 
If we include the temperature dependence, the deformation of the mantle is very complicated.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{My implementation}

The code also relies on $Q_2\times Q_1$ elements for the Stokes equations and 
$Q_2$ elements for the temperature equation. 
The LAB is parameterized as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
def yLAB(x,NZ):
    return np.arctan((x-Lx/2)/(NZ*4))/(np.pi/2)*75e3+475e3
\end{lstlisting}
In the absence of more information in the article it is a bit difficult
to tune the term in the arc tangent function so as to obtain a necking zone 
of the right dimension. I found that \lstinline{NZ*4} does the job.

\section*{Results}

In Eq.~1 of the paper we see that the characteristic time is given 
by $D_0^2/\kappa=(6\cdot 10^5)^2/10^{-6}=36\cdot 10^{16}~\si{\second}\simeq 11408~\si{\mega\year}$.

\begin{center}
\boxed{\includegraphics[width=15cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_168/images/kiso20g.jpg}}\\
{\captionfont Fig.~2 of the paper. NZ=0.05 indicates that $NZ=0.05*L_y=30~\si{\km}$,
$\Ranb=10^6$ indicates that $\eta=$ and Time=$8.8\cdot 10^{-4}$ means 
Time=$8.8\cdot 10^{-4} \cdot 11408~\si{\mega\year}\simeq 10~\si{\mega\year}$ 
and 
Time=$8.8\cdot 10^{-4} \cdot 11408~\si{\mega\year}\simeq 91~\si{\mega\year}$ (
this value is mentioned in the text of section~3).} 
\end{center}

Looking at the figure above we must acknowledge the poor choice of color scale.
Nevertheless, in order to ease comparison, the code also exports the dimensionless
temperature and it will be plotted with the same color scale.

In the text of section~3 we read that the fastest mantle flow velocity
in each model was 43, 4 and 2.85 as shown in Fig.~2a,b,c.
In Eq.~1 we find that the caharacteristic velocity is given 
by $\kappa/D_0=10^{-6}/6\cdot10^5 \simeq 1.67e-12~\si{\meter\per\second} 
= 0.0052596~\si{\cm\per\year}$.
The mentioned velocities are then 0.22cm/yr, 0.021cm/yr and 0.015cm/yr.
