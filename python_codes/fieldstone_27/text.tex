In what follows we will be re-doing the numerical experiments presented in 
\textcite{zhgh93} (1993).

The first benchmark showcases a unit square domain with free slip 
boundary conditions prescribed on all sides.
The resolution is fixed to $64\times64$ $Q_1 \times P_0$ elements. 
The flow is isoviscous and the buoyancy force ${\bm f}$ is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
f_x &=& 0 \nonumber\\
f_y &=& \rho_0 \alpha T(x,y) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
with the temperature field given by 
\[
T(x,y) = \cos(kx) \delta(y-y_0)
\]
where $k=2\pi/\lambda$ and $\lambda$ is a wavelength, 
and $y_0$ represents the location of the buoyancy strip.
We set $g_y=-1$ and prescribe $\rho(x,y)=\rho_0 \alpha \cos(kx) \delta(y-y_0)$ on the nodes
of the mesh.

One can prove (Zhong \etal \cite{zhgh93} and refs. therein) that 
there is an analytic solution for the surface stress $\sigma_{zz}$
\footnote{Note that in the paper the authors use $\rho \alpha g$ which does not have the 
dimensions of a stress}
\[
\frac{\sigma_{yy}}{\rho \alpha g h} =
\frac{\cos (kx)}{\sinh^2(k)}
\left[
k(1-y_0)\sinh(k) \cosh(ky_0)-k \sinh(k(1-y_0))
+\sinh(k) \sinh(ky_0)
\right]
\]

We choose $\rho_0 \alpha = 64$, $\eta=1$ (note that in this case the 
normalising coefficient of the stress is exactly 1 (since $h=L_x/nelx=1/64)$ so it is not implemented in the code).
$\lambda=1$ is set to 1 and we explore $y_0 = \frac{63}{64},\frac{62}{64},\frac{59}{64}$ and $y_0=32/64$.
Under these assumptions the density field for $y_0=59/64$ is:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=7cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_27/rho}
\end{center}

We can recover the stress at the boundary by computing 
the $yy$ component of the stress tensor in the top row of elements: 
\[
\sigma_{yy} = -p + 2 \eta \dot{\varepsilon}_{yy}(\vec\upnu)
\]
Note that pressure is by definition elemental, and that strain rate
components are then also computed in the middle of each element.

These elemental quantities can be projected onto the nodes (INSERT REFERENCE)
by means of the C$\rightarrow$N algorithm or a least square algorithm (LS).

The consistent boundary flux (CBF) method allows us to compute traction vectors $\vec{t}={\bm \sigma}\cdot\vec{n}$
on the boundary of the domain. On the top boundary, $\vec{n}=(0,1)$ so that $\vec{t}=(\sigma_{xy}, \sigma_{yy})^T$ and 
$t_y$ is the quantity we need to consider and compare to other results.

In the following table are shown the results presented in \cite{zhgh93} alongside the results obtained with Fieldstone:

We see that we recover the published results with the same exact accuracy, thereby validating our implementation. Also rather fascinating is the fact that the original paper carries out the whole study without showing any image of the 2D domain ever. 

On the following figures are shown the velocity, pressure and traction fields for two cases $y_0=32/64$ and $y_0=63/64$.

Here lies the superiority of our approach over the one presented in the original article: 
our code computes all traction vectors on all boundaries at once.

\begin{remark}
The original article on the CBF \cite{zhgh93} uses a penalty-based formulation 
(see Section~\ref{MMM-sec:penalty})
so that they do not have to worry about pressure normalisation. However, since constant pressure fields lie 
in the nullspace of $\G$ the pressure normalisation constant does not play a role.
\end{remark}

As shown in Appendix~\ref{MMM-app:mm}, the $Q_1$ mass matrix for the reference cell/element is given by:
\[
{\M}^e=
\frac{1}{3}
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2
\end{array}
\right)
\]
This matrix needs to be multiplied by $h/2$ for an element of size $h$.
Following the methodology presented in \cite{zhgh93}, one can also use the Gauss-Lobatto 
quadrature method to arrive at the mass matrix, and in this case the simple trapezoidal 
integration rule variant thereof (see Section~\ref{MMM-sec:quad1D}).
We then have:
\begin{equation}
{\M}_e=\int_{\Omega_e} \vec{N}^T \vec{N} dV
= \int_{-1}^{+1} \vec{N}^T \vec{N} dr
\end{equation}
on the reference element, with 
\[
{\vec N}^T = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
N_1(r) \\ N_2(r)
\end{array}
\right)
=
\frac{1}{2}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
1-r \\ 1+r
\end{array}
\right)
\]
We know compute the following integrals with the trapezoidal rule:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{-1}^{+1} N_1(r) N_1(r) dr &=& (1--1) \frac{N_1(-1) N_1(-1)  + N_1(+1) N_1(+1) }{2} = 1 \\
\int_{-1}^{+1} N_1(r) N_2(r) dr &=& (1--1) \frac{N_1(-1) N_2(-1)  + N_1(+1) N_2(+1) }{2} = 0 \\
\int_{-1}^{+1} N_2(r) N_2(r) dr &=& (1--1) \frac{N_2(-1) N_2(-1)  + N_2(+1) N_2(+1) }{2} = 1 
\end{eqnarray}
and finally 
\[
{\M}^e=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1
\end{array}
\right)
\]
The resulting matrix is diagonal and it is simply the lumped version of the exact mass matrix.
