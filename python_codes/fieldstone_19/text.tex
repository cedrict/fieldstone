The details of this manufactured solution are presented in Section \ref{MMM-mms1}.

Each element has $m_V=16$ vertices so in total $ndof_V \cdot m_V=32$ 
velocity dofs and $ndof_P \cdot m_P=9$ pressure dofs. The total number of 
velocity dofs is therefore $NfemV=nnp \cdot ndofV$ while the total number of
pressure dofs is $NfemP=nel$. The total number of dofs is then $Nfem=NfemV+NfemP$.

As a consequence, matrix $\K$ has size $(NfemV,NfemV)$ and matrix $\G$ has size $(NfemV,NfemP)$.
Vector $f$ is of size $NfemV$ and vector $h$ is of size $NfemP$.

The reduced coordinates of the quadrature points and their weights are to be found in 
Section~\ref{MMM-sec:quad1D}.

Velocity and pressure convergence rates can be measured for both $3^2$ and $4^2$
quadrature rules:
