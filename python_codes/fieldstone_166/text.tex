\subsection*{Experiment \# 1}

The domain is $[0,1]$, $C_{CFL}=0.5$, $nnx=101$ and $c=1$.

\[
u(x,t) = \sin(\pi x) \cos(\pi c t)
\]

The initial wave field $u$ is as follows at $t=0$:

\end{center}

The min/max values of $u$ as a function are as follows:

The $u$ field is shown hereunder at three different times $t=5,10,15,20$:
