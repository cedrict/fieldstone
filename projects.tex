\item build fast/reliable schur complement solver
\item revisit all tikz of elements and add consistent colours
\item revisit diff/disl creep partition stuff
\item free-slip bc on annulus and sphere . See for example p540 Gresho and Sani book. find book \cite{deab72}.
also check \cite{ensg82} !!
\item constraints \cite{absh79}
\item look at strain-rate softening in \cite{belz02}
\item Material point method \cite{sucs94,susc96,susp07}
\item redo/explore dyn topo bench of \cite{bore19}
\item check \cite{bufm19} for RT0 element use
\item GEO1442 indenter setup in plane ?
\item SIMPLE a la p667 \cite{john16}. Also look at \cite{vusb00} 
\item try Anderson acceleration for Uzawa \cite{hoow17} with m=1. Aitken method for 
fixed point iterations, see Ramiere \& Helfer \cite{rahe15}.
Check Walker \& Ni (2011) \cite{wani11}, Anderson (1965) \cite{ande65}
Boyle \& Jennings (1973) \cite{boje73}, Jennings (1971) \cite{jenn71}.
Aitken method for accelerate nonlinear problems, Chow \& Kay (1984) \cite{chka84}.
Wang \& Wang (1994) \cite{wawa94}. Richardson extrapolation. 
\item implementation of fault in FEM codes \cite{zhgu94,zhgu95}
\item remove nnp from all \stone
\item use 3D benchmark of s75 for s82 !
\item write generic ker program for LBB stab check
\item look at Sobol sequences in Numerical recipes for tracer layout\\
https://people.sc.fsu.edu/\~{}jburkardt/f\_src/sobol/sobol.html
\item redo thie17 in axisymmetric geometry


\item Write about


  \begin{itemize}
  \item Legendre polynomials
  \item harmonic spectrum , see \cite{ribr99}
  \item write about impose bc on el matrix
  \item write about stream functions 
  \item write section in features about thermo mechanical simulations and how/why we solve vp, then T.
  \item write Scott about matching compressible2 setup with his paper
  \item write about vorticity-velocity method: \cite{gats91,gust93,dehu95,ergq99,amct04,spez87}
  \item write about flexural isostasy \cite{maie12}, bottom Sopale
  \item write about splines as basis functions \cite{chri92}. second or third order basis functions , using extra nodes instead of using more nodes per element. 
  Smaller matrix than Q2 or Q3 but: spline coeffs on nodes are no more unknowns. Plus bc are complicated. Does it work well with visc contrasts ?
  \item write about jacobian tensor and norm for Q1 rectangles. and more ?
  \item write about Courant nb
  \item write about number representation, binary, min/max ... 
  \item appendix E finish/update
  \item generalised averaging of ELEFANT paper
  \item write about Aitken extrapolation, see for example \cite{jolm17}
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Open questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item what does it mean to have a negative pressure ? should we threshold it when computing yield strength ? 
\item Why pressure bc works for Q2Q1 but not Q1P0 ??
\item is there a formal definition of shape fct, trial fct, basis fct vs test fct 
\item is there an efficient manner to start from (say) quadrilateral mesh defined by corners only, choose an 
order $n$ corresponding to $Q_n \times Q_{n-1}$ and generate nodes without doubles?
\item where in the maths does it say that I cannot prescribe a T for an outgoing flow boundary?
