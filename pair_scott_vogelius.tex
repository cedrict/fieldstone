It originates in \fullcite{scvo85} (1985). 

 
In Remark 9 (p.29) of \textcite{aubb17} (2017) we find:

We also remark that the discontinuous
pressure version of the Hood–Taylor element typically
results in an unstable method. However, stability can be
recovered by imposing certain restrictions on the mesh for
$k \ge 3$ (see \cite{voge83}; \cite{scvo85}), or
by taking advantage of suitable stabilization procedures for
$k\ge 1$ (see Mansfield, 1982; Boffi, 1995).

In \textcite{fams21} (2021) we find:

The Scott-Vogelius element is given by choosing continuous piecewise 
polynomials of degree $k$ for the velocity and discontinuous piecewise 
polynomials of degree $k-1$ for the pressure. While this clearly
implies that $\nabla\cdot V_h \in Q_h$, inf-sup stability of the 
Scott–Vogelius element is more delicate, and is a topic of ongoing research. 
In two dimensions, Scott \& Vogelius proved \cite{scvo85} that the element is inf-sup
stable for $k\ge 4$ if the mesh does not have nearly singular vertices. 
In three dimensions, it was proven more recently in \cite{zhan11b} 
that the element is stable for $k\ge 6$ on uniform meshes. The stability on general
tetrahedral meshes continues to be an open question.

On barycentrically refined meshes, however, the pair is known to 
be stable for polynomial order
$k = d$, see [48, Section 4.6] for the 2D case and 
\cite{zhan05} for the 3D case. If one is willing to 
consider the more complicated Powell–Sabin split, the order 
can be reduced further to $k=d-1$ \cite{zhan08,zhan11a}. The two
refinement patterns are shown for the two dimensional case 
in Figure 1 [see below]. In this work we will consider
the case of $k \ge d$ on barycentrically refined meshes, but 
the arguments apply mutatis mutandis to the Powell–Sabin split.

\textcite{cael11} (2011) state:

The SV element pair is not yet very well known,
and so we now give a brief description of it. In essence, the SV pair is the same as
the Taylor-Hood pair except that the pressure space is discontinuous and either
(i) for $k \ge d$, the mesh is a barycenter reﬁnement of a regular mesh, or
(ii) for $k = 2, d = 3$, the mesh is formed from a barycenter reﬁned mesh by
connecting the barycenter nodes (i.e., a Powell–Sabin tetrahedralization).
In short, polynomials of degree $k$ and $k-1$ are used to approximate the velocity
and pressure spaces, respectively, and the mesh ${\cal T}_h$ that is used must be derived from
a regular triangulation (tetrahedralization) of $\Omega$, where each element is reﬁned as
stated above. With these mesh constructions, it was proved by Zhang in [42, 44] that
the SV elements are LBB stable, and, consequently, also have optimal approximation
properties. It is well known that the TH pair is LBB stable and admits optimal
approximation properties for these cases as well [9]. We will restrict our deﬁnition of
SV elements to these cases where they are LBB stable.

On page 112 of \textcite{john16} we read:
\begin{displayquote}

The Scott–Vogelius finite element considers still $P_k/P^{disc}_{k-1}$, $k \ge d$, 
but on special meshes, which allow to show the satisfaction of the 
discrete inf-sup condition.
[...]
This pair of finite element spaces $P_k/P^{disc}_{k-1}$
are weakly divergence-free, which is a desirable property.
[...]
The fulfillment of the discrete inf-sup condition 
was proved already in \textcite{scvo85} (1985) in the two-dimensional 
case for $k\ge 4$ if there is no so-called singular vertex in the mesh.
An internal vertex is said to be singular if edges which meet at the vertex fall onto
two straight lines.

The basic idea to overcome this problem consists in using meshes 
without singular vertices. To this end, so-called barycentric-refined 
grids are constructed. Starting from any admissible triangular mesh, 
new edges are introduced by connecting all
vertices of a mesh cell with the barycenter of this mesh cell. 
This step creates smaller triangles.
On barycentric-refined meshes, the $P_k/P^{disc}_{k-1}$, $k=2,3$ 
pair of finite element spaces was shown to satisfy the discrete inf-sup
condition in Qin's phd thesis (1994). [...]

The use of the $P_2/P^{disc}_{1}$ pair of finite element spaces 
on barycentric-refined meshes can be found occasionally in the literature,
in particular to demonstrate the advantages of using pairs of finite element 
spaces which provide weakly divergence-free velocity solutions, 
e.g. see \textcite{john15} and refs therein.

I hereafter present my own internal numbering for the mesh above (used in \stone~120 for example).
The quadrilateral has been cut once along a diagonal, and then an Alfeld split is used, thereby 
dividing the square in 6 triangles:

\input{tikz/tikz_sv.tex}

See also \textcite{jolm17} (2017) in which the $P_2\times P_1$, Scott-Vogelius ($P_2\times P_{-1}$), 
Bernardi-Raugel, and $P_2^+\times P_{-1}$ elements 
are compared for a thermo-mechanically driven convection problem in a triangle (see \stone~51, 
although I use the $P_1^+\times P_1$ element in this stone).

In \textcite{befh21} (2021) this element is used in its 
$(P_3)^2-P_2^{\text{disc}}$ form.

Note that some have proposed to use an incenter-based refinement instead of
a barycenter refinement since it lead to less pronounced aspect ratios\footnote{
The Scott-Vogelius Method for Stokes Problem on Anisotropic Meshes, K Kean, M Neilan, M Schneier,
\url{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2109.14780}}.
In geometry, the incenter of a triangle is a triangle center, a point defined for 
any triangle in a way that is independent of the triangle's placement or scale. 
The incenter may be equivalently defined as the point where the internal angle bisectors 
of the triangle cross or as the point equidistant from the triangle's sides.

Given the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle ABC,
the coordinates of the incenter O are
\[
x_O=\frac{ax_A+bx_B+cx_C}{a+b+c}
\qquad
y_O=\frac{ay_A+by_B+cy_C}{a+b+c}
\] 
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the side lengths opposite vertex A, B and C.
