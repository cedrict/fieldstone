It is described in Barnes (1999) \cite{barn99}:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\sigma} = \sqrt{\sigma_y} + \sqrt{\eta_p \dot{\varepsilon}_e} 
\end{equation}
or, when squaring it:
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sigma_y + \eta_p \dot{\varepsilon}_e + 2\sqrt{\sigma_p \eta_p \dot{\varepsilon}_e} 
\end{equation}
This model has been found to accurately describe the behaviour of synthetic based muds \cite{adlo17}.
