I have BSc in mathematics, and an MSc diploma in physics (with a specialization in 
musical acoustics \cite{dewl02}). I did my PhD at the 
university of Groningen (The Netherlands) title {\sl Thermodynamically consistent 
fluid particle modelling of phase separating 
mixtures}\footnote{\url{http://cedricthieulot.net/thesis.html}}.
Although half of the thesis deals with the re-derivation of the Navier-Stokes 
equations for such systems\cite{esth03}, the second half is concerned with 
the implementation of these equations with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
method \cite{thje05a,thje05b,thes05}.

I then taught physics and programming at the University of Rennes (France) for a year, 
after which I did a 2-year post-doc with Prof. J. 
Braun\footnote{\url{https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/jean-braun/}} in the 
Geosciences department. 
I then did a 4-year post-doc with prof. R. 
Huismans\footnote{\url{https://folk.uib.no/huismans/}} at the University of Bergen (Norway), 
followed by a 3-year post-doc with profs. T. Torsvik and W. Spakman at the Utrecht
University (The Netherlands). 
Since June 2015 I am assistant professor there in the geophysics group.
