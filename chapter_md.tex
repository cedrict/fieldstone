\chapter{Mantle Dynamics GEO4-1416 syllabus (Utrecht University)} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{remark}
Note to myself and potential reader: 
There are still many areas that should be revisited: the entropy/specific entropy problem. 
And the pressure \& Stokes approx, and mechanical stress.  
I need to homogenise notations for strain rate and deviators.
also I need a tensor name that is not tau for mechanical stress.
